These days I‚Äôve been getting my daily coffee fix at Foody‚Äôs on Nanjappa Road, Shantinagar (off Double Road). It‚Äôs right opposite the quirky and charming [Jaaga](http://www.jaaga.in/), which has been serving as my office for the past two months. Don‚Äôt let ‚Äú*right opposite‚Äù* fool you ‚Äì one still needs to cross the formidable Double Road twice and need to deal with two directions of traffic. Some day I‚Äôll post a video so you can fully appreciate the ordeal.

But the coffee is *always* worth the ordeal. A strong authentic South Indian filter kaapi for Rs. 7! You can get a stronger brew at no extra charge. So far I‚Äôve resisted the temptation for the stronger brew for fear that I might like it. At Rs. 7/pop, I could probably sip a cup every hour and not feel a twinge of guilt. But do I?

No sir. Strange as it may sound, I‚Äôm becoming quite disciplined in life. Rhythm and predictability have now become ‚Äúgood words‚Äù in my vocabulary. My first Foody‚Äôs coffee is at 8:30am ‚Äì park car -&gt; walk to Foodys -&gt; buy coupon -&gt; drink coffee -&gt; cross road to Jaaga -&gt; start my workday. My second Foody‚Äôs coffee is between 10:30am and 11am. That‚Äôs it ‚Äì two coffees.

On some Thursdays (when my morning speed training run has been rather intense), I need two coffees at the 10:30am break. A few weeks ago, I noticed something weird when I got my second back-to-back cup. Can you spot what‚Äôs different between the two cups in Picture #1?

If you can‚Äôt make out any differences, have a look at this next picture ‚Äì both cups are empty.

If you still haven‚Äôt figured out, here‚Äôs a slightly different view of the two empty cups.
