After two years of Reva ownership, I faced my first flat tire on Saturday. Fortunately it was discovered in the garage so no inconvenience there.

Sunday morning I headed downstairs to the parking area with an OMG-I’m-going-to-help-daddy 9-year old as my helper. A few minutes after we had surreptitiously exited the apartment, mommy had to face major fireworks from the young ‘un. The volcanic fire was eventually quelled with repeated assurances that *next time* would be his turn.

Replacing the flat tire with the spare was surprisingly easy – it took us about 20 minutes. If you haven’t seen a Reva *in the metal* yet, the spare tire and the jack are neatly positioned under the hood itself (see picture to the left).

Later in the evening, after we returned with a fixed tire and finished dinner earlier than usual, an opportunity presented itself. An opportunity to make amends to the young ‘un because, you see, the emotional health and well-being of the family rests on how well the mascot of the family is *feeling*. Does this sound like appeasement? Not in a hundred years.

When I announced to the young ‘un that he was going to help me put the fixed tire back in the hood, he seemed happy enough — but nowhere close to the OMG-I’m-going-to-help-daddy vibes I got from the older one. As we walked out the door, on an impulse, I propped our 9 year old in the middle of the living room couch, switched off the lights, put on Keith Jarrett’s *T[he Köln Concert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_K%C3%B6ln_Concert)* and told him to *just listen*.

As we walked down the stairs, the little grumbler of course had to ask “When will ***I*** get to listen to music like ***that***?” That’s when I delivered my killer line “There are always ***many*** awesome things we could be doing at any time. ***You*** are helping me put the spare tire back in the hood, your ***brother*** is listening to some nice music alone in a dark living room. Both of you are having fun, right?”

The normally argumentative and competitive child didn’t answer. It doesn’t happen often so definitely a hopeful sign.
