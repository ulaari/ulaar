In 2002, I ran my first marathon – the Silicon Valley Marathon in San Jose. Finished in a respectable time of 4:32. After a 6-year hiatus, I resumed running after our return to India in August 2008. I had struck an optimistic note in [Asthma, Bangalore and me…](https://www.ulaar.com/2008/08/29/asthma-bangalore-and-me/) but deep in my heart I feared that my asthma would return, a case of *when* rather than *if*.

With the sword of Damocles hanging perilously close to my lungs in our first [100 days in Bangalore](https://www.ulaar.com/2008/12/14/100-days-in-bangalore-part1/), was trying really hard to squeeze in a few runs every week. During one of those perambulating-around-the-apartment-complex runs, I was ‘spotted’ by ace Bangalore marathoner Ashok Nath. I say ‘spotted’ because he knew right away that:

- I had it in me to be a distance runner
- My form could use some improvement – my hands were open like a sprinter, instead of the lightly closed fist of a distance runner

After that chance encounter, Ashok persuaded me to register for the Bangalore Midnight Half-Marathon, a mere month away. With the most threadbare of training, I completed the Half-Marathon. A side effect of the half-marathon was my hooking up with an entire cast of rabid marathoners in Koramangala. The rest was history. Eight months later, I ran my second full marathon (and my first in India) in Srirangapatnam. It was an emotionally painful, slow and grinding marathon. However, the experience compelled me to return to Kaveri Trail in 2010 to [make amends](https://www.ulaar.com/2011/01/16/marathon-4-race-report-kaveri-trail-marathon-2010/). The period between the two Kaveri Trail Marathons was quite eventful – a [creditable showing at the Mumbai Marathon](https://www.ulaar.com/2010/01/28/my-road-to-mumbai-marathon-2010/) in Jan 2010 followed a month later by an un-ignorable case of “moderate” slipped disc.

Contrary to popular perceptions, “slipped disc” does not signal the end of an active and adventurous lifestyle. Slipped discs are neither caused by, nor are they exacerbated by, running. But they are to be respected and one *does* need to make adjustments to one’s life. The good orthopedist Dr. Srinivasan (of Malleswaram fame) assured me that if I religiously did a set of three exercises twice daily (before breakfast and dinner) I could continue with my worship of the running gods. Having stuck to this regimen 90% of the time in the past 21 months, I’m pleased to report that I’ve had only one episode of back pain (lasting around 4 days). Then there’s was also the little matter of resisting macho urges when it comes to lugging suitcases. For the other, more important, matter of resisting paternal urges to pick up the darling kiddos, a creative workaround thankfully presented itself. \[*Update (Sep 2012)*: [Discs don’t slip suddenly. Really.](http://www.ulaar.com/2012/09/13/discs-dont-slip-suddenly-really/)\]

I ended 2010 with four full marathons under my belt. In the next calendar year, I had doubled the count to eight, in the process logging a mileage of 2000 km for 2011.

My wife, in describing my last marathon of 2011, had this to say *“Vishy just crossed the line from being plain-old-crazy to ultra-crazy”*. Can’t really argue with that characterization but is there more to the story than mere craziness? Did I have a master plan? Had I become an endorphin-snorting marathon addict? How did I fare in those four marathons and what had I learnt? Stay tuned for the next post in this series – answers to those questions and some more.
