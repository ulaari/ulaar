2012 has been the year of social enterprise challenges and social enterprise incubators in India. The exciting addition to the former is Tata Group’s announcement of the Tata Social Enterprise Challenge, a joint initiative with IIM Calcutta. Details below.

**TATA Social Enterprise Challenge – A Joint Initiative with IIM Calcutta** aims to be India’s biggest platform to help identify and support India’s most promising social enterprises. Organized by IIM Calcutta &amp; Tata Group, Tata Social Enterprise Challenge will invite from across India both for-profit and not-for-profit business plans that create a **sustainable and measurable social impact**.

The business plans will be judged critically by India’s most renowned Social Entrepreneurs, Business Leaders, Social Venture Capitalists, Foundations and Academicians.
