Rockefeller Foundation turns 100 in 2013. To mark its centennial, they are seeking knowledge and innovation ideas that will solve problems for the next 100 years – specifically in the areas of farming, irrigation efficiency, and leveraging data to improve the lot of vulnerable communities.

Fifteen finalists, five in each of the three categories, will be selected by a distinguished panel of judges and recognized at the 2012 Innovation Forum on June 28. They may be invited to collaborate with The Rockefeller Foundation as it builds the Global Engagement Network, a network of problem solvers focused on key global problems. As many as nine out of 15 finalists will be selected by the Foundation to apply for up to $100,000 in grant support to further develop or implement their ideas.

**Decoding Data**: Ideas that create better ways to address urban challenges through the application of data.

**Irrigating Efficiency**: Ideas that help reduce barriers—such as lack of investment, incentives, or political will and capacity—to implementing and scaling agricultural water use efficiency.

**Farming Now**: Ideas that encourage and help young farmers to become more productive, more resilient, and more profitable by addressing cultural perceptions, economic conditions, and/or climate change.
