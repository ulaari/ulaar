A few months ago, I wrote [Social Enterprise Jobs in India – Who’s Hiring](http://www.techsangam.com/2012/02/29/social-enterprise-jobs-in-india-whos-hiring/) – a first look at the social enterprise job landscape in India. Since then, I’ve been on the lookout for interesting social enterprise jobs — not for myself of course — but for an increasing subset of my social graph that’s taking notice of the social enterprise movement. Today, as part of my research on Khosla Impact, I stumbled upon [Khosla Impact Careers](http://ventureloop.com/khoslaimpact/) — list of open jobs at their four portfolio companies. I’ve cherry picked four super-interesting jobs from the list:

- **Director of Product Design at Driptech (**Pune)****: *Come join Driptech, a for-profit, impact-focused, high-visibility startup selected as a 2012 Technology Pioneer by the World Economic Forum, named by BusinessWeek as one of the world’s most intriguing new companies, and voted by its readers as one of the top 5 most promising social ventures in America. Driptech is laser-focused on making affordable irrigation technologies for small-plot farmers in developing countries. This position requires the desire and ability to lead Driptech’s product development efforts for our affordable irrigation systems. It will require demonstrated design skills, engineering and manufacturing experience, and leadership at all phases of the product development process. This role will manage an international team, and most have a track record of outstanding project successes.* \[[More here](http://ventureloop.com/khoslaimpact/jobdetail.php?jobid=101036)\]
- **Head of Products at Embrace Innovations (Bangalore)**: *Interested in changing the face of healthcare? Join Embrace, a for-profit social enterprise with a vision to bring affordable healthcare technologies to the base of the pyramid. Backed by Vinod Khosla and Silicon Valley-based Capricorn Investment Group, Embrace has quickly become a leader in the healthcare impact space. We’ve been featured on TED, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, and in 2011, won the INDEX: Design to Improve Life People’s Choice Award. Embrace has developed and launched an innovative infant warmer for vulnerable babies. We’re now looking to scale this product across India and the emerging markets while expanding our portfolio of healthcare solutions. The Head of Products will report to the CEO and will be the force behind developing and executing Embrace Innovations’ overall product strategy to ensure Embrace continues to grow into a profitable, high-impact organization.* \[[More here](http://ventureloop.com/khoslaimpact/jobdetail.php?jobid=101509)\]
- **Director of Product Design &amp; Implementation at MokshaYug Access (Bangalore)**: *MokshaYug Access(MYA)is a rural supply chain solutions company. It is in the business of building income certainty for rural producers through our participation across every component of the rural supply chain. This involves establishing strong rural-producer relationships, rural-producer yield improvement programs and procurement infrastructure in rural areas, and delivering high quality rural produce to consumers in urban markets through multiple retail channels. MYA is a venture capital backed, revenue-stage company with funding from Vinod Khosla‘s Impact Fund, Unitus Equity Fund and Unitus Impact. The ideal candidate will have a rare mix of creative design thinking, technical acumen and executive leadership, thus capable of motivating and managing an inter-disciplinary team. This will require demonstrated design skills, engineering and prototyping experience, as well as comfort with and exposure to industrial and contract manufacturing.* \[[More here](http://ventureloop.com/khoslaimpact/jobdetail.php?jobid=101500)\]
- **Vice President Product Strategy and Management at Kopo Kopo**: *Kopo Kopo is changing the way consumers interact with merchants in emerging economies. From mobile payments to advertising to customer service, Kopo Kopo is building a platform that transforms the merchant-consumer experience. Kopo Kopo is seeking a VP of Product Strategy and Management who will play the lead role in defining and improving Kopo Kopo’s suite of products and services.
