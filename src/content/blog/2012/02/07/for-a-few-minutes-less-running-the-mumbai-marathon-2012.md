This is Part 2 of my Mumbai Marathon 2012 race report and continues from [For a few minutes less: a race report from Mumbai Marathon 2012](https://www.ulaar.com/2012/02/01/for-a-few-minutes-less-a-race-report-from-mumbai-marathon-2012/).

**The First 7k**

Somewhere in my pace calculations, I erroneously concluded that 5:50 was the goal pace for a 4 hrs 10 min finish. Perhaps 6 seconds/km is not significant to the seasoned runner but in my limited experience I‚Äôve learnt that every attempt to run faster (than trained for!) in the first half has come back to bite me in the second half. So, my first running mistake was an arithmetic one. üôÇ In order to account for my extra mile of sprinting (and anxiety) before the starting line, I revised my pace ‚Äì by a ‚Äògenerous‚Äô margin of 5 seconds and stuck to a 5:55 pace for the first 5k.

It was the first race where I was in sole possession of last place ‚Äî at the 10 meter mark. Having survived 45 minutes of anxiety, I was just plain relieved and happy. I told myself that I would overtake hundreds, most likely even thousands of runners ‚Äì that pumped me up. At the 2k mark, my pal Jothi (here‚Äôs his [race report](http://jothi-reflections.blogspot.com/2012/01/scmm-2012.html)) yelled an encouraging ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù. I waved back knowing fully well that, with my revised goal pace, I wasn‚Äôt going to catch up anytime soon. As I alluded to earlier, an important pre-race ritual had been missed ‚Äì emptying the bladder. What started as a mental distraction soon turned into a physiological nag. Keeping a lookout for a [Sulabh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulabh_International) on the Marine Drive stretch, the first open one was sighted at the 7k mark. Turned out to be a quite a popular loo ‚Äì the pit stop having cost me nearly two minutes.

**7k to 21k**

Maintaining an average pace of 5:56, I steadily overtook groups of runners. I slowed down going up the Pedder Road incline and, after reaching the top, went tearing down with long strides. I gained no more than 20 seconds but it was done to get the adrenaline pumping. Crossing the Bandra-Worli sea-link was fairly uneventful, especially compared to the [2010 edition](https://www.ulaar.com/2010/02/14/running-the-course-mumbai-marathon-2010/). Somewhere between 15k and 20k, I overtook Rahul Verghese‚Äôs 5:30 pacing bus and Amit Sheth/Neepa Sheth‚Äôs 5:00 pacing bus. The latter was a high-octane peloton with several catchy slogans.

**Gobs of Gu and Sacs of Salt**

Whether it‚Äôs the first, fifth or tenth marathon you are running, if something ends up deviating from plan, it will only happen in the second half (most likely in the last 10k). I crossed the half-way mark in 2 hrs 5 min. It should have triggered a ‚Äúgoing too fast per my revised goal‚Äù warning bell but it didn‚Äôt. In any case, it was too late to make any adjustments and my body and mind were in good harmony at this stage. I was so focused that I passed Ravi Venkatesan (a fellow [BHUKMP ](http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110612/jsp/7days/story_14102339.jsp)runner) without noticing him. He called out and, for fun, I did a 20 second burst of reverse running while engaging in a short conversation. I recall thinking this guy ran a fast first half ‚Äì that too in his first full marathon.

For all but two of my marathons, I‚Äôve been carrying a Gatorade bottle and using [Gu gels](http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Gel-Mandarin-Orange-24-Count/dp/B003V1TNJY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1328594466&sr=8-1). The only change I made for SCMM2012 was to consume a gel every 5k (instead of 6k), so a total of 8 energy gels. It didn‚Äôt feel like I overdid it so I‚Äôll repeat this for the next race too.

After suffering severe calf cramps in the season‚Äôs first marathon (Hyderabad ‚Äì Aug 2011), I used [Endurolyte capsules](http://www.amazon.com/Hammer-Endurolyte-Capsules-Bottle-Plain/dp/B001AYMJFE/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1328594730&sr=1-1-catcorr) (mostly salt) for the next race (Kaveri Trail Marathon ‚Äì Sep 2011). They seemed to work because I didn‚Äôt cramp at this venue for the first time in 3 consecutive years! At the Bangalore 50k Ultra (Nov 2011), the Endurolyte tablets weren‚Äôt sufficient to stave off several bouts of calf cramps. My running experts told me that 5 capsules probably didn‚Äôt account for the hot weather. So I came to SCMM2012 armed with ***8*** endurolyte capsules.

**The eventful second half**

Shortly after passing Ravi at the halfway mark, I started feeling some niggles ‚Äî in my quads and hamstrings. The quadriceps and calf muscle groups had made their presence (and displeasure) felt in many earlier marathons but the hamstring niggle was new. I popped some extra Endurolyte capsules as a preemptive measure, dropped my pace a wee bit ‚Äì ran 20-25k at 6:00 pace and the 25-30k stretch at 6:04 pace.

Somewhere in the region of 32-33k, my right hamstring niggle morphed into a moderate cramp. All signs in the preceding 10k were pointing to this eventuality but I was still disappointed. If my marathons #1 through #4 were characterized by struggles with exhaustion and cramps in the final 10k, marathons #5 through #9 have been devoid of exhaustion. Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì I would be plenty tired at the 32k mark but my energy meter still showed plenty of juice. So my last 5 marathons have primarily been struggles against cramps ‚Äì thank god for small mercies!

I stopped, did some general stretches and continued at a slower pace. I repeated this sequence and was it a wonder that my 30-35k lap pace was 6:40? Worse was around the corner. Close to 36k, my moderate hamstring cramp turned into a full blown cramp. As I passed a friend and fellow Bangalore runner (Sunil Chainani), I asked him if he had any miracle cure for a hamstring cramp (I had exhausted my supply of salt tablets by now). Of course a miracle cure was not to be (yet)!

I continued (my now familiar) ritual of running-walking-stopping-stretching. Somewhere in the 30-36k stretch, I passed fellow Bangalore runners (Sridhar and [Satsang](http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymile.com%2Fpeople%2Frsatsang%2Fentries%2F12177636&h=zAQEKEDlaAQE2cP1rABXuMMrLdB0tsWFzA7qE8bDKH-SJuw)) and Chennai runner Ridhima Suri. For a while, Sridhar, Ridhima and I were playing a cat-and-mouse game with each other. At the 38k mark, my fortunes turned. As I pulled under one of those green ‚Äòoasis‚Äô tents with cool water sprays, I asked a fellow runner if he had a pain spray. What he *did* have (and kindly offered) was a Volini pain relief sachet. I liberally applied the gel to my right hamstring and, on a hunch, also applied it to my left hamstring. 10 seconds later a miracle happened ‚Äì the above Asterix visual is the best way to describe how I felt! Of course I didn‚Äôt attain superhuman strength but my cramped hamstring had been banished to some temporary jail and that, my friends, was superhuman enough.

I had 4k more of road to pound so I took off like a released torpedo. According to my calculations, I was definitely going over 4 hrs 20min but there was just a chance I could salvage a PB out of this race. The 35-40k leg was negotiated with an average pace of 7:28 ‚Äì probably would have been 8:30 without the Volini. For the final 2.5km, I finished strong with a 6:21 pace ‚Äì the course ended up being 42.5km (not 42.2km). My net time turned out to be **4 hrs 24 min 3 sec** ‚Äì shaving 2 1/2 minutes from my previous PB at Auroville 2011.

**Closing Thoughts**

Notwithstanding my blunder-laced start, there were several positives to be drawn from my 9th marathon finish:

- Did not run out of energy in the final 10k ‚Äì revised goal pace mostly in the ball park.
- Rebounded from my hamstring cramps creditably (thanks mainly to the benefactor at 38k)
- Mentally a lot stronger in the final 5-7k than all previous marathons.
- Salvaged a PB in spite of cramps, 2-minute pit stop, extra 300 m, extra mile of sprinting before race start.

The biggest open question I need to address for next season is cramps. This time it was hamstring, last few times it was calves, and before that it was quadriceps. What‚Äôs a sure training and race-day strategy to prevent cramps? (my next research area) And yeah, even if I figure it out, need to carry pain relief spray for sure.
