If this is the first time you’ve heard of Howard Lutnick (or Cantor Fitzgerald), do read [this](http://www.businessinsider.com/cantor-fitzgerald-9-11-story-howard-lutnick-2011-9), [this](http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/horror_still_haunting_dreams_YEqKA4kXH3T2kTpBQJj0xO), and [this](http://www.cantor.com/press_releases/Howard_Lutnick_Comments_Devastated_by_911_Deaths_Cantor_Fitzgerald_Fights.html). Yesterday, I came across a FUCCHA post that listed out a long list of wonderfully humanitarian things that Ratan Tata did after 26/11 – not just for the Taj employees but for a veritable ecosystem of people/establishments *around Taj*. While this is making the Sharing rounds on Facebook now, it appeared in the blogosphere as far back as May 2010 – [here](http://balajitechnology.wordpress.com/2010/05/16/what-ratan-tata-did-for-the-mumbai-victims-what-every-indian-should-know-and-govt-shd-learn/). Assuming the list is at least 50% accurate, let’s applaud Ratan Tata. Then again, we have also come to expect this of the Tatas (in general) and Ratan Tata in particular. Earlier I wrote why I was [excited about Ratan Tata’s retirement](http://www.techsangam.com/2012/07/12/why-i-am-excited-about-ratan-tatas-retirement/).

And now for the much talked about Facebook share…

> Kasab is hanged, everyone’s happy. Some people are praising Pranabda for this, while some the UPA governance. Now that everyone’s happy lets go back to November 2008, Hotel Taj when &amp; where this happened, and meet a real hero, Sir Ratan Tata.
