**Q**: What happens when a British woman with a degree in Classics and Sanskrit from Oxford University moves to Bangalore?

**A**: She falls in love with an Indian fashion designer and a Royal Enfield Bullet aficionado (yes â€“ thatâ€™s ONE person). She becomes a Bullet aficionado, he becomes a Sanskrit buff, they get married and live happily ever after.. in Bangalore.

Her story is obviously a lot more interesting and multi-faceted than described above and doesnâ€™t really end here ðŸ™‚

She (Venetia Kotamraju) has set up a small Sanskrit publishing house called Rasala â€“ [www.rasalabooks.com](http://www.rasalabooks.com/). Venetia and her co-founder (Shankar Rajaraman) are inviting submissions for an anthology of verses on the theme â€˜nightâ€™.

<div>Are you a Sanskrit buff or know someone whoâ€™s a Sanskrit professional or moonlighter? If you answered yes, please spread the word and, if you have any verses (your own or those of your favourite poets), you can [contact Venetia here](http://www.rasalabooks.com/contact-us/).</div><div></div><div>**Q**: How do I know Venetia and (gosh) am I interested in Sanskrit?</div><div>**A**: I once rented a Bullet motorcycle for 2 weeks from her brother-in-law, discovered her credentials and love for Sanskrit and have been in touch. I used to suck at Sanskrit in school. During my years in Chicago I developed a mild interest in Sanskrit, attended a 2-week Spoken Sanskrit workshop (which was a lot of fun). Sadly, itâ€™s *one* of my many interests that somehow donâ€™t make it to the â€˜priority listâ€™.</div><div></div>
