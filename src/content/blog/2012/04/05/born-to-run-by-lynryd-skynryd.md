I’ve had Lynryd Skynryd’s The Last Rebel album in my music collection for years (maybe even decades). As I was listening to my “Rock” genre in random mode today and it started playing “Born to Run”, it struck me “Hey – this is the same title as that famous running book by McDougal!” I replayed the song a few times, paying extra attention to the lyrics.. then gave up and dug the lyrics from eLyrics.net.

*There’s an old man sittin’ on a front porch now*  
*Talkin’ ’bout how it used to be*  
*When I was young I was a hell of a man*  
*My father died when I was ten*

*I hit the road to find a job, had to feed my family*  
*Times were hard my hands are still scarred*  
*From the life I’ve had to lead*  
*I was born to run*

*Drove a tractor and trailer all my life*  
*Six kids and a hell of a wife*  
*Made lots of money it all slipped away*  
*A large family that’s the price you pay*

*I always dreamed never gave up*  
*Son, even when times got tough*  
*That’s when I’d push it a little bit more*  
*You should’ve heard that engine roar*

*I was born to run, I can’t slow down*  
*No regrets, I’ve been blessed*  
*Born to run, in time you’ll see*  
*What the good Lord’s done for me*  
  
*Born to run, I can’t slow down*  
*No regrets, I did my best*  
*Born to run, in time you’ll see*  
*What the good Lord’s done, done for me*

*The old man, he passed away*  
*And all he said never crossed my mind*  
*Until I saw the price he payed*  
*Was a lot like mine*

*I’m full and though it’s miles away*  
*I gotta hit the city right on time*  
*And when I’m on I’ll always sing little song of mine*  
*I was born to run*

*Oh, I was born to run, I can’t slow down*  
*No regrets, I’ve been blessed*  
*Born to run, in time you’ll see*  
*What the good Lord’s done for me*

*Born to run, I can’t slow down*  
*No regrets, I did my best*  
*Born to run, in time you’ll see*  
*What the good Lord’s done, done for me*

*Son, I was born to run*  
*Oh, I was born to run*

If you are a runner, bet you were as disappointed as me to learn that “born to run” is more of a general metaphor. Anyway, one less thing to wonder about.
