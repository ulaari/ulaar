Three tweets from @albatrossinfo (RT’d by CentreRight India’s Prasanna Viswanathan) caught my attention this evening.

> 1\) As a nation we are a race of people with such low expectations from the ruling class that even basic govt functioning is lauded as great

> 2\) The idea is deep-rooted; ex: Akbar was great because he just about treated Hindus as slaves but at least didn't try to convert them

It also reminded me of an old post — really a Facebook thread resurrected on my blog — [Enough with the “we need better leaders” nonsense!](https://www.ulaar.com/2010/08/23/enough-with-the-we-need-better-leaders-nonsense/)
