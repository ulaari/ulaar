*Disclaimer*: The title of this post suggests that I do these posts every week but alas! the reality is that itâ€™s more like every quarter or so. [Volume 3](http://www.techsangam.com/2012/08/27/this-week-in-social-enterprise-jobs-volume-3/) (Aug 2012) featured jobs from Mumbai-based Desta and in [Volume 2](http://www.techsangam.com/2012/05/07/this-week-in-indian-social-enterprise-jobs-volume-2/) (May 2012) I cherry picked jobs from Khosla Impactâ€™s portfolio companies.

The trigger for this edition is a Facebook message I received from Julie Kriegshaber. She had written with a request to publicize open positions at the company she was going to join *â€“ a month later*. The post on her social enterprise journey â€” *The road to mPaani goes through Uganda and Bloomington* â€” is still languishing in the Drafts folder but this post addresses her primary request ðŸ™‚
