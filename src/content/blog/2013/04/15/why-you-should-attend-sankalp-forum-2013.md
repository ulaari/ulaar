[![sankalp_2013](../../../../uploads/2013/04/sankalp_2013.jpeg)](../../../../uploads/2013/04/sankalp_2013.jpeg)By now they should have changed the venue of Sankalp Forum from Mumbai to Bangalore. I attended the third edition of Sankalp in 2011. The only reason I missed it last year (and will sadly be missing this year’s edition too) is because it’s in *Mumbai*, and not *Bangalore*.

Is there any other metro that has a vibrant and growing [social enterprise happy hour club](http://www.techsangam.com/2012/04/13/firang-invasion-of-indias-social-enterprise-ecosystem/)? And if that wasn’t reason enough, 20% of this year’s Sankalp finalists are headquartered in Bangalore. Well, there’s always next year I suppose. Btw, if one digresses at the *beginning* of an article, is it still digression?

Coming to the subject of this piece… many reasons why you should attend Sankalp Forum 2013, especially if you live in (or nearby) Mumbai.

1. It is THE largest watering hole for social enterprises and impact investors. I’ve never heard of M&amp;A in the conferences space before but Intellecap has pulled off a merger of sorts in combining Sankalp Forum with Chennai-based Villgro Unconvention to create Sankalp Unconvention Summit.
2. Energy/cleantech social enterprises again making their presence felt – 20% of the award finalists are from the cleantech sector – Avani Bio Energy, Claro Energy, Frontier Markets, and Green Power Systems.
3. Like [last year](http://www.techsangam.com/2012/04/10/5-reasons-excited-sankalp-forum-2012/), I’ve picked my favorites from the list of 20 finalists (see below).
4. Day one of the Sankalp Unconvention Summit will host the G-20 Inclusive Business Workshop and organised by the Governments of Germany and Saudi Arabia. G20 Pillar theme – “Private Investment and Job Creation.” Interesting to see Saudi Arabia
