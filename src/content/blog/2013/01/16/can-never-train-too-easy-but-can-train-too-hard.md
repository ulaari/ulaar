My running pal (Sunil) shared this great Buzzfeed article ([The Runner’s Recovery Masterclass](http://www.realbuzz.com/articles/the-runner-s-recovery-masterclass-gb-en/#pagination-top)) that puts recovery at the heart of a runner’s training plan. If you are a marathon runner (at any stage in your evolution), you should read it. If you are a morphed product of the ADD generation, I’ve cherry-picked thirteen axioms from the article. How easy was the cherry-picking? Extremely easy because the writer had these in bold – the title of this blog post is #12. Go on – skim the list below and go read the article which also includes helpful suggested training (&amp; recovery) week templates.

1. <span style="line-height: 13px;">Most people think that training is all about mileage or intensity. It’s not! <span style="color: #0000ff;">The key is recovery</span>.</span>
2. <span style="color: #0000ff;">STRESS + REST = ADAPTATION</span> (aka “<span style="color: #0000ff;">Training + Recovery = Improvement</span>“)
3. In the long-term the <span style="color: #0000ff;">well-planned application of this ‘stress + rest’ scenario will allow you to handle more training,</span> which means you force more adaptation.
4. Much like your quality of life; <span style="color: #0000ff;">training only works well if you can accept that rest is as important as work.</span>
5. <span style="line-height: 13px;">From a training perspective, it is <span style="color: #0000ff;">the rate at which the human body adapts to stress that separates individuals</span>. </span>
6. For example, it is common knowledge that the body needs at least 24 hours to recover from a hard workout. But few people realise that <span style="color: #0000ff;">the body struggles to handle more than four hard training weeks in a row</span>. Or that few people can handle more than three hard years in a row before their performance starts declining. The secret is to find how much rest you body needs, not only day-to-day, but also month-to-month and year-to-year.
7. In general, <span style="color: #0000ff;">long, relaxed running requires less recovery than high intensity speed work or races</span>.
8. And in general <span style="color: #0000ff;">road running requires more recovery than cross country or trail running</span>.
9. In general <span style="color: #0000ff;">long runs seem to need at least 24 hours recovery and high intensity sessions 48 hours recovery</span>.
10. You also need to <span style="color: #0000ff;">allow at least 24 hours of easier running after hilly runs</span>. For some people this recovery period might be complete time off. For others it might just be easy running or cross-training.
11. If every two to four weeks you ease back to about 50% of your normal volume, then you have the <span style="color: #0000ff;">basis for a good cycle of stress versus rest</span>.
12. <span style="color: #0000ff;">**You can never train too easy, but you can train too hard**</span>.
13. Put simply – <span style="color: #0000ff;">improving your running is about finding your own balance of stress versus rest</span>.

**Recovery tips** (also from the article)

- Long days should be followed by an easy day.
- High intensity days should be followed by two easy days.
- After races take an easy day for every 15min that you raced.
- Hill training should be followed with flat training.
- Try scheduling the easy days for when you’re busiest at work or home.
- Take at least one easy week every month.
