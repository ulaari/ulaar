If you don’t know much Madhu Kishwar, you might be interested in her take on [nuanced positions and polarizing/predictable media](http://www.ulaar.com/2012/08/21/madhu-kishwar-nuanced-positions-polarizing-predictable-media/).

Lest you think Kishwar’s observations are the ‘Minority Report’, here’s what Economic Times wrote about day #1 – [encomium pours for Narendra Modi from Indian/Foreign/Industry bodies](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/vibrant-gujarat-summit-2013-encomium-pours-for-narendra-modi-from-indian-foreign-industry-bodies/articleshow/17984155.cms).
