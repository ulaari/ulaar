TechCrunch [reports](http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/03/unitus-seed-fund/) that Bangalore/Seattle-based Unitus Seed Fund got a fresh infusion of $8 million from a bevy of A-list investors – from Silicon Valley and Bangalore. I believe the entry of the Silicon Valley investors represents a major inflection point for the Indian social enterprise ecosystem. A major inflection point — not because there’s an incremental pool of $8 million available for investing — but because of the type and caliber of Silicon Valley investors (notably Vinod Khosla and Dave McClure). I believe this has the potential to kickoff a virtuous cycle in Indian social entrepreneurship — more new investors and of course more social entrepreneurs. Khosla has already invested in a few social enterprises through [Khosla Impact](http://www.techsangam.com/2012/06/05/two-bright-lights-in-indias-impact-investing-landscape/) fund (no LPs here, just his personal money) so this infusion into Unitus Seed Fund is a further endorsement of his already bullish assessment.

**About Unitus Seed Fund** (prior to this infusion)

Unitus Labs (a non-profit) launched this fund sometime in 2011 but publicly announced its existence in Feb 2012 in tandem with its first three investments — Hippocampus Learning Centres ($1.5 million) , Bodhicrew Services, Villgro, and Milaap Social Ventures. Dave Richards (CEO of Unitus Labs) is also the Managing Director of this fund.

**About New Investors**

- Vinod Khosla (relevant Indian ecosystem appellations include [Khosla Impact](http://www.techsangam.com/2012/06/05/two-bright-lights-in-indias-impact-investing-landscape/) and Khosla Labs)
- Mike Murray (co-founder of Unitus Labs)
- 500 Startups (of Dave McClure fame)
- Jeff Clark (unable to disambiguate his pedigree)
- Bob Gay (formerly Bain Capital)
- TV Mohandas Pai (Aarin Capital Partners and former CFO Infosys)
- Dr. Ranjan Pai (Manipal Education and Health)

The two Pais (who apparently are not related according to [this ET article](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-01-04/news/36148931_1_vinod-khosla-ranjan-pai-mohandas-pai)) are contributing $2 million into this fund which means the five other investors (at least three of whom are from Silicon Valley) are investing $6 million. A few of the TechCrunch comments are interesting (and thus reproduced below).

McClure’s allusion to [500 StartupWallah](http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/21/500-startups-micro-funds-india-mexico/) (microfund focused on plain-old technology startups in India) when he says “BOP” or other communities.

> 500 Startups is super excited to be working with folks like [Dave Richards](https://www.facebook.com/daveric?group_id=0), [Mike Murray](https://www.facebook.com/mikemur100?group_id=0), [Vinod Khosla](https://www.facebook.com/vkhosla?group_id=0), Geoff Wooley, and other former Unitus alumni to help create new ventures, new jobs, and economic opportunities in India. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Whether or not it’s “BOP” or other communities that require innovative solutions</span>, we are big believers in the use of creative capital to solve problems, move mountains, and make money. We are “all in”.

Khosla Impact’s Mark Straub looking to co-invest…

> Congrats to Dave, Will and Srikrishna,  
> I look forward to working with, and co-investing with them in the future.

By the way, the two Pais investing $2 million is also a great sign.. and needs to be discussed in a separate post.

Oddly, the TechCrunch story was published on Jan 3, 2013 but it didn’t show up in my daily TechCrunch email (damn you Feedburner!)
