The author is my older son who’ll soon turn ten. He wrote this story four months ago for a school assignment. Barring some editorial help from his mother, the plot and storyline is all his.\]*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

One day, in the ocean, a fish named Speedo was swimming around Fish City looking for an international fish-thief nicknamed “The Gliding Shark”. Speedo was a fish police detective. Minutes went by, hours went by and then suddenly he saw something. Slowly he crept towards it. It was only then he realized that it was a hole dug recently because it had loose sand. He also found a *finker-chief* with the initials G.S. Those were the thief’s initials. Wow! A clue! Soon it was time to go back after some more searching.

Later, in his crime lab, Speedo checked the *fin-prints*. They did not belong to the Gliding Shark. These unusual *fin-prints* must belong to one of his hench fishes, Speedo thought. Maybe one of them had his *fin-kerchief* and dropped it while digging.

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

The next day Speedo came back to the spot he was searching and all of a sudden heard a sound. CLANK! SWISH! CLANK! Slowly Speedo peeped in the direction of the sounds and almost fainted at what he saw. A cruel-looking fish was digging away sand with a spade. He could dimly see G… and another letter on the spade. What was the other letter? he thought. In a flash, the thought came to him that it must be the Gliding Shark!

As slow as a turtle, as quiet as a mouse, Speedo swam away. After a while he began to swim faster and faster. Soon he reached Fish City’s police station, huffing and puffing. He pushed his way in and ran straight to the *fish-inspector*. Speedo explained all the important events to the *fish-inspector* who got excited and ran to bring his *fish- officers*. Soon, they all were swimming at full speed to the crime spot.

Instead of showing themselves immediately, the *fish-officers* had a plan. Each and every officer followed Speedo over the (cave shaped) mould of hard mud. First two, then four, six, eight and more eyes peeped down. The *fish-inspector’s* jaw dropped and he almost slipped off the mould. An extraordinary thing happened. First, Speedo quietly requested the *fish-inspector* to send an officer with *fin-cuffs* to the bottom of the mould and watch what happens.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

One *fish-officer* bent down to carefully inspect the *fish-thief’s* work and jumped up in a few minutes, scaring the other *fish-officers*. The officer excitedly explained that the *fish-thief* was digging out metal and other unidentified stolen objects. On hearing this, Speedo whirled around and dived straight off the mould and knocked the *fish-thief’s* spade down. Just as he signalled the *fish-officer* with the *fin-cuffs* and tried to get hold of the *fish-thief* – the *fish-thief* began swimming away at the speed of sound. When the other *fish-officers* and *fish-inspector* dived down, the *fish-thief* was even more scared and ran helter-skelter, pushing dustbins in his path, throwing rocks into *fish-houses* (CRASH!) and hitting anyone in his way.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It was very tough for the *fish-police* to manage the thief. After a while, two *fish-officers* swam to a side path. When the *fish-thief* noticed that fewer *fish-officers* were chasing him, he was mystified. Suddenly, Speedo shouted “This is the real culprit!” Meanwhile, the Gliding Shark soon found out what happened to the other *fish-officers*.

Before you could finish blinking your eyes, the two missing *fish-officers* appeared. One of them put fin-cuffs around the *fish-thief’s* fins. In a few weeks, the valuables were found in the *fish-thief’s* home along with his fake fins.

This is my first attempt to write my own novel. It was a school assignment. I enjoyed writing it but it took a lot of hard work from me. I would like to thank my mother for her support.
