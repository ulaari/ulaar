*\[*<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span>*: a boring race report is one where everything largely goes per plan. The below update, a brief account of Mumbai Marathon 2014 was shared on my Facebook group, as a prelude to a race report. But, as I learnt later, was there anything more to say? I put it here as a reference to future blog posts.\]*

Dear friends,  
Had a fantastic race. Ravi made the mistake of asking for my story at the airport last evening and he got the VERY detailed account. Here’s the two words version: *very satisfied*.

I didn’t want to squeak in for a sub-4 finish but blow past it – goal largely achieved (finished in **3:48**). First race where I didn’t cramp – 2 cocojals did the trick (I had visualized them as my two six-shooters. Emptied the first one’s bullets at the 7k mark, second one was downed after the halfway mark. Strategy to go close to 5:00 pace for *as long as possible* paid off. Decision to run barefoot (as opposed to 4mm’s) vindicated and I really loved it for 90% of the race. Great BF-friendly course barring 3 stretches where asphalt was very coarse – the last Marine Drive stretch (where Jugy/Sunil cheered us) and broke some momentum and yes – the only time I wished I had 4mm protection. Did “catch-back” \[old [BHUKMP](http://www.ulaar.com/2014/02/24/the-cult-of-bhukmp/) lingo for allowing your friends behind you to catch-up\] with Pankaj and Bahuja at 3 different points – I surged ahead each time. Pankaj *ko motivation mila hoga* since he surged past me in the last 700m <span class="_47e3 _5mfr" title="smile emoticon">![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/f4c/1/16/1f642.png).</span>

Played cat-and-mouse with Vaishali between 21k and 39k. She was super-focused but I couldn’t resist a very brief conversation. I was not sure how to tackle the Peddar hill so I asked her. Pat came the reply – *“Can slow down but don’t stop running, increase arm swing, drop stride”* and I followed the good woman’s advice.

First race as “Veteran”, first FM race with the analog Titan Edge (glanced at it maybe 4-5 times). 5:11 in the 1st quarter, 5:12 in the 2nd, 5:21 in the 3rd and 6:00 in the 4th. The split graphs make it look like a steady slowing down (it sure \*felt\* that way in the last 10k).

Overall rank: 159, category rank: 23. Can’t really complain.

Thank you – oh running gods! It finally all fell into place.

**Name Key**

- Ravi (Venkatesa**m**): once a runner, now an ex-runner, parallel entrepreneur
- Pankaj (Rai): someday I’ll feature him on The Talking Runner post, but not because he needs any introductions. The entire Indian running community (heck, a good chunk of India) knows him well.
- Sid Bahuja: super-talented super-fast and uber-cool Sid. Ran sub-3:20 races 5 years ago without any structured training. Somebody we’ll convince him to train *just enough* to run a sub-3:00.
- Vaishali (Kasture): celebrity runner, celebrity corporate honcho, Marathon Major Grand Slammer
