I’m a huge fan of Marc Andreessen.

I won’t wax eloquent about Andreessen but draw attention to his 2011 WSJ article [Why software is eating the world](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460). The article (specifically the title/quote) strongly resonated with me. It continues to influence my world view of the type of companies effecting dramatic changes in the world.

Twitter religion came late to Andreessen but he’s making up by posting frequently and insightfully.

He asked an interesting question today..

> Does anyone know of well-regarded econ research on the broad economic impact of computers/IT/software/Internet as a deflationary force?

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" type="text/javascript"></script>Following the responses (and there were MANY), he puts forth his thesis on ongoing role of Moore’s Law and impact on technology trends..

> Responses to those 3 deflation questions prompted questions about ongoing role of Moore’s Law especially if chip speeds are topping out.

> 1: On a device (e.g. smartphone), rising use of parallelism (more cores and/or chips for same $), including graphics &amp; many new sensors.

> 2: In cloud, massive parallelism applied against many more big problems — Google &amp; FB just the start; amazing new services in many sectors.

Moving from “software is eating the world” to “software as a lever on the world”. 🙂
