*\[<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Editor‚Äôs Note</span>: It‚Äôs been almost four years since I started running with (and became part of) the BHUKMP cult. I never got around to writing about BHUKMP, aptly described as a ‚Äúcult‚Äù rather than a group. The name itself is an acronym for the six races that every member should strive to run in a single season. BHUKMP = B\_angalore Midnight, H\_yderabad, Bangalore U\_ltra, K\_averi Trail, M\_umbai, P\_ondicherry/Auroville. In this post, the cult attempts to outline its core ideologies in the form of ‚ÄúThou shalt‚Ä¶‚Äù\].Multiple references to Dandi should clue you on to the fact that it‚Äôs a dominant part of the cult‚Äôs psychic rhythm. The Dandi Way shall be the next post in this series.\]*

Thou shalt get out of bed before sunrise at least ONCE a week.

Thou shalt save the Friday beers for Saturday.

Thou shalt run at least a 24k Dandi every Sat morning

Thou shalt run the 30k Dandi run every Sat morning.

Thou shalt run Dandi even if all other BHUKMP‚Äôrs have gone out of town for a BHUKMP run and you couldn‚Äôt.

Thou shalt be considered a member if you join the group on a Dandi run at least once and share your life story.

Thou shalt be very pissed off if, after having made the effort to run Dandi, one misses being in the group photo at Cubbon on account of being too slow!

Thou shalt recruit anyone running alone on Dandi route.

Thou shalt brood over the Dandi group photo after missing the Saturday run.

Thou shalt feel an extraordinary sense of pride at running more than a half marathon distance every Saturday and treating it like a simple morning run!

Thou shalt always runverse with fellow BHUKMP‚Äôrs except perhaps at the races.

Thou shalt DNF only under extenuating circumstances..

Thou shalt DNF and earn the right to judge the DNS (Did Not Start).

Thou shalt run the Comrades at least once before you die or you CANNOT die.

Thou shalt run a full marathon every month.

Thou shalt cherish the after run breakfast, talk about it in runversation and, if needed, fight to get your choice of restaurant agreed.

Thou shalt not feel shame in demanding new members to treat the group in expensive places.

Thou shalt focus only on having a good time but will end up having a good timing at times.

Thou shalt not judge the slow runner‚Ä¶ or the elite runner.

Thou shalt not discriminate based on religion, caste, creed or choice of footwear (or lack thereof).

Though shalt always obey The Village Elder bechara elder group se bahar ho gaya hai.

Thou shalt not be judgemental about \*crazy\*. Crazy is a continuum, not a point.

Thou shalt use a Garmin. Or not.

Thou shalt overcome and hope to RUN (not run/ walk/ stroll) 10 kms.

Thou shalt WALK all the races if you are incapable of joining the Sat Dandi run.

Thou shalt write stupid posts in the group even if you are not able to run with them every Saturday in the hope that you don‚Äôt get thrown out of the group.

Thou shalt know the difference between the tank and the TANK.

Thou shalt either measure time or distance, but never both together.

Thou shalt strive to run/walk faster or further.

Thou shalt strive to stay (or catch up) with the peloton.

Thou shalt NOT, even for once, think about stealing fellow runner‚Äôs huaraches.

Thou shalt win a podium position and treat the group to breakfast!

Thou previous evening shalt the run even if drunk Thou got.

Thou shalt get more &amp; more people addicted to the madness called running‚Ä¶

Thou shalt promptly post to your blog, the contents of the crowd-sourced FB post that you started üôÇ

Thou shalt never forget ‚Äúwhat happens in BHUKMP/Dandi stays in BHUKMP/Dandi‚Äù or else‚Ä¶
