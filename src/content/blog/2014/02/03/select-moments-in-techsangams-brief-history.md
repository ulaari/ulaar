Rumors of TechSangam‚Äôs demise are greatly exaggerated.

This post was meant to be about [this](http://win.blogadda.com/view-blogs-voting/news_media/Confluence_of_social_enterprises_and_civil_organizations/). (But DON‚ÄôT click on that link just yet‚Ä¶ indulge me for a few more paragraphs please! There‚Äôs a bit of an anti-climax so all the more reason to wait!)

In June 2013, I announced my full-time foray into an [entrepreneurial venture](http://www.techsangam.com/2013/08/18/a-different-kind-of-indian-city/). If you then thought that the blog was headed for a protracted period of suspended animation, you‚Äôd have been right. Six posts in six months is the VERY definition of *suspended animation*.

In Aug 2013, BlogAdda announced their (possibly first) Blog Awards. It seemed like a metaphorical straw. I grasped it. I nominated my blog. A few weeks ago, the good folks from BlogAdda wrote back with the surprising news that TechSangam was among 11 finalists in the News and Media category. This was particularly gratifying since it was an A-list [jury](http://www.blogadda.com/blog-awards/jury).

The BlogAdda email also had this exhortation..

> You are as close as possible to the finish line and at such a stage, you don‚Äôt want to let it go, do you? For the last leap we want the community to like, tweet, comment and tell us who their favourite is! Have a look at all the top blogs, ‚ÄòLike &amp; Tweet‚Äô to encourage and increase your favourite blog‚Äôs chance of winning! 
>
> Every vote is ought to make a difference, for your blog to reach the top 3! Tell your family and friends to spread the word!

Crikes! This put me in a spot of bother. Now I needed to do *more work* to get past the finish line?I was ambivalent about the extent of self-aggrandizing I wanted to indulge in. I was also suffering guilt pangs of having neglected what was once a full-time activity for seventeen months.I like forcing functions. They sometimes offer redemption.I was going to make a fresh pledge to myself and to my readers. Like [Vishnu‚Äôs favorite devotee](http://www.techsangam.com/2011/09/23/vishnu-favorite-devotee-myth-and-its-relevance-to-social-enterprises/), I would resolve to pay obeisance (i.e. blog on TechSangam) as often as possible. And make it happen this time.So what are the select TechSangam moments I wanted to showcase in this post? Well, it was going to be the twists and turns, and the many ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments that I experienced during my blogging journey. But since that‚Äôll take another hour (which I don‚Äôt have), I present the Top 25 most popular blog posts ‚Äì I believe that tells the story as much of the blog‚Äôs readership as it does about the blogger.
