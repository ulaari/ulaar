<div> Our Guruvugaru Garu came to Rourkela in ’67 August to take us to Samai a village near Agra Ramlalprabujis asram (our paramaguru )was situated there. Srinivas was 4 years old I was carrying Jani (7th month) .</div>
<div> We alighted night train to Agra The big trunk box was of big discussion .it was quite big and caused frown to my uncle also .we used to carry it for journeys because 3 of us packed all our stuff in that gigantic trunk As soon as we got down my uncle who came to receive us was not at all happy as it is a bit difficult to fit into his small car</div>
<div> …. Now the same box made us argue in a low tone so that Guruvugaru will not hear but he did hear and supported me He quietened nannagaru by saying ‘are you going to lift? Anyway Porter will lift’But was a big task to nannagaru because he had to help the Porter I felt very guilty</div>
<div> … . It is a practice to Guruvugaru not to take any outside food He will plan his trips in such a way that he will break his journey in a known place where he can have home food that means journey will prolong.</div>
<div> .. Our 1st halt was in Bilaspur He took us to his distant relatives house .He was working in railways It was a spacious railway quarter After finishing bath ect they served hot and tasty food .I still remember the beera kai koora (I tried to make like that but couldnt)</div>
<div> … .. Our next halt was in Jhansi.On the way to their house Guruvugaru told us with a smile that’s ere we have to cook ourselves because they are kshatriyas’ I got a shock! It was already meals time when will we go and cook?this shock was there till some time</div>
<div> They were also co disciples he was a professor very simple people both of them in pure white dress and looked bright and blissed she gave me moong dal with pottu keera rice and kerosene stove! With nannagaru’s help I could cook and it gave me immense satisfaction in serving Guruvugaru we enjoyed the simple food . Because many years passed I am not able to remember some night halts .The professor couple also gave us some hints about sadhana.</div>
<div> . Before going to Amritsar let me finish about big trunk It was used till we came to Vizag I used it as a godrej and locker till then We stopped using it Instead we carried 2 3 small suitcases. We ultimately we dropped in a scrap place for 10 rupees!!</div><div> Thank God soon after marriage I didn’t carry this Started with 2 suit cases which I got as marriage gift and holdal Otherwise nannagaru would have a shock</div><div> Let me come to the story …. We proceed towards Amritsar .On the way I remembered to have seen some old forts I am sure of Gwaliar fort We got down at Jalandar station early in the morning We had to wait for sometime to change our train Guruvugaru cautioned Nanna to be alert He said’be careful here women will be kidnapped’s I wondered who will kidnap a pregnant woman?</div><div> We reached Amritsar there is an asram here After asram he took us to two of his co disciples ladies One was Matha Droupadi and anotherMahatma Rishi devi who was quite senior and great sadhaka Here again we cooked our food i It was not shocking this time I made phulkas and sabji in a chocolate with nanna’s help</div><div> . . Annayya was very happy to get big glasses of thick milk He and Guruvugaru had good time They both used to go in one rickshaw (not cycle rickshw)Once he made run around the house by taking away his amrutanjan bottle He used to be very active I used to pinch that poor fellows cheeks (sorry Srinu) We visited the beautiful</div><div>Golden temple It was a great feeling to see the illuminated shining temple.</div><div> .. .Our next halt was in Samai asram this was the destination Nanna packed a lot of sweets (pal kova)and fruits in a basket We reached in the evening Chandramohangaru was in charge of the asramam (guruvugaru s colleague we were allotted a parnasala like thing where r rushis used to stay in the olden days Samai was a quiet small village We stayed there for 4 days The parnasala house was made of mud with thatched roof .it was cool inside .There were 2 wooden cots and a pot full of water</div><div> We got up early morning The chirping sound of birds. cattle bells and sound of crushing the fodder with a hand machine was so peaceful to the mind. As any other olden time village there were no toilets.There were bathrooms to take bath.</div><div> .. Guruvugaru gave deeksha and I was asked to meditate in the small guha (cave like thing)peaceful!This was for 3 days.</div><div> .. ….. .. .. Guruvugaru made us sit beside him and we were served satwik food red kumda.bheerakai like sabji with hot phulkas very tasty ofcourse But my system got heated .On Guruvugaru s request I was served rice</div><div> … .. In the evenings villagers used to gather for Samsung After some bhajan s both the Gurujee s gave small pravachans After dinner slept early It was definitely memorable</div><div> .. Our next halt was in Agra j We reached there by car (nearbyonly)We had night halt in a doctors railway quarter He was was one Dr Sharma a railway doctor .The spacious quarter was full of railway workers to do service.</div><div> . . The doctor couple were friendly smiling all the time .They had a kid (annayya’s age)The couple were chewing paan most of the time .The doctor was not at all .l in a hurry to go to office He was taking it easy .During lunch time the couple did an elaborate pooja and gurujee s harati prasadam was in a big thali with lot of dishes along with sweets.We had a feast that day.</div><div> . After lunch we planned to see Tajmahal and other places around Guruvugaru didn’t appreciate that much saying all those are Muslim tombs what will you do there Guruvugaru stayed back in the house</div><div>. … We went by a tanga to Tajmahal.I just can’t express my feeling on seeing Tajmahal We were hearing about this monument.one of the 7th wonder since we started History lessons It was marvellous.We went inside also and satisfied</div><div> … ……… ..Tangawala took us around some other places like Fatepur skri if I remember correctly we came back to take rest</div><div> . Next day we reached Delhi capital of India!Guruvugaru took us to his relatives house .That day was sravana sukra varam.The lady of the house who was looking like Lakshmi devi made pulihora and poornaboorelu The baby inside me would have been very happy! The gentleman was an auditorAfter lunch Guruvugaru left for Rajahmundry by Janata express.After dropping him in the station we went to nanna’s cousins house .She was Seshu Seshadri mavayya elder sister Her husband V S R Murty was a manager in Andhra bank .</div><div> …. ….They had 2 kids .Kumar was 1 year older to annayya and Venkatesh was younger to annayya. We stayed over night .The 3 kids had good time .Very few guests will come all the way except grandparents. We also used to feel the same way to see guests in Bokaro.That day being last Friday of sravana month some body had invited for perantam (haldi kumkum )I wore new checked black sari which my friend .PadmaRaghavan bought it from Madras After seeing the sari Seshu exclaimed and said , (I have got the similar one I will wear that)People were simple and plain in those days we went by car .It was tough time managing the 3 kids Seshu introduced me proudly ‘she is my athayya s daughter in law ‘</div><div> ……. Must be thinking how long it goes I have come to the last lap.Chandram annayya my cousin came to take us to their house. As you know C annayya and Sirisha are my cousins second cousins to nanna Annayya nannagaru and Ramudu babai were childhood friends.</div><div> … We stayed here overnight Next day morning we took a tourist bus to go around Delhi We saw kutubminar.Indiagate parliament house ect They stopped near a tourist hotel for lunch After lunch again went around like Ashoka stoop a I don’t remember much Our last stop was at Red fort Time was allotted for shopping I didn’t do much exceptcar toys to all the children I remember to buy a cute velvet purse I wanted a marble roti rolling thing Nanna bought it for me next day with my annayya’s help. Subbu Sasis sister who was in the hostel also came there (being Sunday)</div><div> .. . . Seshu made pala poori to celebrate her husband’s birthday. He came to the station to drop us I remembered to have passed through Agra .The good Sarma couple brought rotis and gorchikkudu kai koora for dinner!So nice of them</div><div> . We reached Rajahmundry by the famous Janata express I don’t don’t know whether it is there with the same name .After a brief visit to Gantivillage nannagaru put us in the train to vja He stayed back to take yoga treatment for his urinary problem</div><div> . .. . Tatayya and ammumma had been waiting in vja to takeo me toMadras for delivery So he came to the station with Sarma and Sastry let me stop here otherwise it will go on till delivery!! That’s it for the time being.</div><div></div><div><div> I forgot to write this important event in Rajahmundry We did stay there for one day in a lawer disciple’s house In those daysKanchi paramacharya was on deeksha in Godavari district Guruvugaru took nannagaru to the place where he was stationed After meeting him and taking teertham they came back to have lunch .Myself and Srinu were at home. SURE</div><div> . . Same evening he took us to the Godavari riverbank Paramacharya was just coming to the bank after bath Guruvugaru addressed Paramacharya in Sanskrit He showed me and Srinu and told him she is my disciple Krishnamurty’s wife and he is his son Paramacharya looked at me at least for 2 seconds .I always remember the powerful piercing eyes During meditation also I try to recollect So that was gurus grace Because we didn’t have darshan in the morning he saw that we too got his blessings</div><div> Later all of us with ammumma and tatayya went to kanceepuram and had his blessings .Then he was staying far away from ashram in a kuteeram He was on Mouna deeksha .</div></div>
