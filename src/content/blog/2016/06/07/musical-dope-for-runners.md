There was a time I used to listen to music while running. This might come as a surprise to my runner friends in Bangalore but it’s true.

Chicago (circa 1995-96)

Getting the high on W93.1 in Chicago along Lake Shore Driver  
Jettisoning it during my 1st FM training (I even remember the exact point on Fremont Ave when I looked with utter abhorrence at the Sony Dreammachine) – too much weight and too distracting.

Kouros’s mentioning listening to patriotic Greek songs.

Banshee Beats  
Turbo Lover, Breaking the Law
