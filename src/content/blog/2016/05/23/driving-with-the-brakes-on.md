This was a song and band I hooked on to during my Chicago years (1994-98). Easily the era where my musical heart was at its spongiest best. Recently the lines *driving with the brakes on* and *swimming with your boots on* seemed evocative of my last five years of barefoot running. I’m usually not much for finding out *what* a song is about… am mostly about the *sound* and *feel*. But the lyrics made me dig deeper.. on the great fan web. Read the lyrics below (or better still, give it a listen) and leave a comment on what *you* think the song is about.

*Driving through the long night*  
*Trying to figure who’s right and who’s wrong*  
*Now the kid has gone*  
*I sit belted up tight*  
*She sucks on a match light, glowing bronze*  
*Steering on*

 *And I might be more a man if I stopped this in its tracks*   
*And said, come on, let’s go home*   
*But she’s got the wheel,*  
*And I’ve got nothing except what I have on*

 *When you’re driving with the brakes on*   
*When you’re swimming with your boots on*  
*It’s hard to say you love someone*  
*And it’s hard to say you don’t*

 *Trying to keep the mood right*  
*Trying to steer the conversation from*   
*The thing we’ve done*  
*She shuts up the ashtray, I say it’s a long way back now, hon*   
*She just yawns*

 *And we might get lost some place*   
*So desolate that no one where we’re from would ever come*   
*But she’s got the wheel and I’ve got to deal from now on*

 *When you’re driving with the brakes on*  
*When you’re swimming with your boots on*   
*It’s hard to say you love someone*  
*And it’s hard to say you don’t*

 *But unless the moon falls tonight*  
*Unless continents collide*   
*Nothing’s gonna make me break from her side*

 *‘Cos when you’re driving with the brakes on*   
*When you’re swimming with your boots on*  
*It’s hard to say you love someone*  
*And it’s hard to say you don’t*

 *It’s hard to say you love someone*   
*And it’s hard to say you don’t*

Psst… What do you think the song is about? Leave a comment, will ya!
