I did the following short li’l summary of my Tull concert experience in the[ 100 Days in Bangalore ](https://www.ulaar.com/2008/12/14/100-days-in-bangalore-part1/)post. What I’m adding to this post is the concert discography (which I had tweeted) and a few Qik videos which you should check out only if you are a Tull die-hard (there are no audiophile or videophile gems here).

*Thanks to my dear biwi, I was alerted about Tull’s Dec 2 concert in Bangalore at the Palace Grounds. I couldn’t believe it! If I needed a musical ‘welcome home’, this was it. I’ve been to 4 prior Tull concerts (three in Chicago, and one in San Jose) and I don’t miss an opportunity when Tull comes a touring. My dear biwi (bless her heart again!) was going to hold the home fort on Dec 2 (a weekday evening) while I indulged myself. Found several colleagues who were Tull enthusiasts so eventually we had a gang of five. A dear friend from SF Bay Area had to cancel his business trip due to illness so spot#5 got filled in the eleventh hour by another dear friend (from my Xaviers Bokaro days). Considering that this concert took place 5 days after the Mumbai attacks, we headed to the concert with some mixed feelings but ended up having a rollicking time. Ian Anderson was at his entertaining best. It was not a classic Tull concert – Part 1 was Anoushka Shankar and her troupe, Part 2 was classic Tull, and Part 3 was a fusion with Tull and Anoushka. The encore closer was a very unique and incredible live variation of Locomotive Breath with sitar and bansoori blending in exquisitely.*

Discography (Part 2 onwards):

- Living in the past
- Serenade to a cuckoo
- Nursie
- Too old to rock and roll, too young to die. (Ian dedicated this to 65 yr old Sir Mick Jagger)
- New day yesterday
- Heavy Horses
- Thick as a Brick (abridged version)
- Aqualung
- (Part 3) Tea with Anoushka
- (Part 3) Celtic Cradle? A fusion of celtic, irish &amp; indian music. Tull with Anoushka (on sitar) &amp; Tanmoy Bose (on tabla).
- (Part 3) Mother Goose with Anoushka and 2 block flutes.
- (Part 3) Little Glass folk – very orchestral fusion piece which eventually turned out to be real good.
- Bouree
- Locomotive Breath. Adding the bansuri, sitar &amp; tabla was a GREAT touch to this seminal live performance!

Great fusion piece from Part 3: <span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ygYKVA0jnbI?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" type="text/html" width="700"></iframe></span>
