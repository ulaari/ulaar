Put two Indians (perfect strangers mind you) in a room and it’s merely a question of time before they find a few common connections. As you might suspect, I epitomize this quintessential Indian quirk.

1. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Paper Cup Saga</span>: In our first week in Bangalore, during that honeymoon period when work had not yet consumed me, I had the luxury of reading the Times of India (TOI) cover-to-cover. I read a very interesting story in the business section entitled [After all your paper cup is not that eco-friendly](http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=VE9JQkcvMjAwOC8wOC8zMCNBcjAxOTAw&Mode=HTML&Locale=english-skin-custom). The story was about a Texas Instruments (TI India) employee creating an informative video that persuaded the employees to significantly reduce paper cup usage. Being ‘green’ at heart, my thoughts immediately raced to achieving a similar outcome in the [Adobe India](http://www.adobeindia.com/) office. Since TOI publishes the reporters’ email addresses, I was able to dash off a quick note asking them whether they could share the video produced by TI. My attention then went to one of the authors – Sujit John. Was it the same Sujit who was school captain (three batches my senior) at [St. Xaviers Bokaro](http://www.stxaviersbokaro.org/)? A quick LinkedIn search confirmed it. Turns out, he’s Times of India’s Bangalore-based Business Editor. Wow! my first solid contact in the Indian [Fourth Estate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Estate). To top it, Sujit is married to Alice (one of my Xaviers Bokaro classmates).
2. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Intel Folsom Connection</span>: As I mentioned in [The First Week in Bangalore](https://www.ulaar.com/2008/08/25/the-first-week-in-bangalore/), we spent the first three weeks in a guest house flat on Bannerghatta Road. The flat was in an apartment community called Adarsh Vihar – two buildings next to the Adobe office so it was very convenient for us. As Bangalore apartment communities go, Adarsh Vihar was small (less than 100 flats) but they have a decent playground which the kids and I would frequent on most evenings. One of the kids mom (Sharmila) had moved to Intel Bangalore (from Intel’s offices Folsom, California). I knew exactly ONE person in Intel Folsom – BTV Anant Kumar (my dear friend and classmate from [BIT Mesra](http://www.bitmesra.ac.in/)). Turns out Sharmila and her husband (who also worked at Intel Folsom) knew BTV and his family very well, in fact they were even next-door neighbours for a few years in California. Gee! What are the odds? We exchanged updates on BTV’s miraculous recovery after a month in the ICU.
3. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Bokaro/Jamshedpur Connection</span>: P and I were sitting in Alok &amp; Babita Sinha’s (owners of the Raheja Residency flat we are renting) living room relating about our life’s *ram kahani* (“life’s story” for my non-Indian readers). The conversation eventually led to Bokaro and Jamshedpur (two eventful places in my past). Alok runs a division of [Symphony Services](http://www.symphonysv.com/) and had a long fruitful stint at Tata Motors Jamshedpur (previously known as TELCO). Turns out that yet another Xaviers Bokaro classmate (Aman Sinha) used to in Alok’s group at Telco. Not only that, Alok and Aman (who is in the SF Bay Area) met as recently as a few months ago. On a final coincidental note, I had reconnected with Aman (at Hobees Cupertino) just a few weeks before our exodus from California.
