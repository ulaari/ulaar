Back in my undergraduate alma mater ([Birla Institute of Technology Ranchi, India](http://www.bitmesra.ac.in/)), the *ulaar* moniker referred to students who were [ *gentlemen of leisure*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585673919/sr=1-1/qid=1155681215/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-6204788-6960902?ie=UTF8&s=books), or in other words, displayed very little interest in scholarly pursuits. So how did these characters spend their time (you may ask)? A great majority of them indulged in inebriation, smoking and rowdy behavior – perhaps not very different from certain fraternity organizations in US universities. Some of the reclusive *ulaars* also resorted to excessive sleeping. The related term *ulaari* refers to the *act of being ulaars* – in other words, if you were spending exam nights indulging in binge drinking, you were doing *ulaari*.

In certain minority circles, the ulaar moniker morphed to a more broader state of mind where one “didn’t have a care in the world”. The *moderate ulaar* has not abandoned scholastic ambitions but realizes that there’s more to life than a single-minded pursuit of academic excellence. During my years at BIT, Mesra, I was a moderate ulaar though, I daresay, none of my friends could have surmised it.
