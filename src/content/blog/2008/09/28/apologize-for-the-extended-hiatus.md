Itâ€™s been 3+ weeks since my last post â€“ I know! Work has kicked into high gear and Iâ€™m barely keeping my nose above water. The 1st month honeymoon period at work is over â€“ time to take over the world. ðŸ™‚

Iâ€™m developing a fresh appreciation for the part-time blogger. The full-time blogger merely has to juggle between work (writing) and family. The part-time blogger has to juggle between work (the gig that pays the bills), family (what feeds the soul), and finding that slice of 1-2 hours to complete a post. Meanwhile, the following posts are awaiting the finishing touch while fresh topics are clamoring for my mind share.

- The man called Murali Menon
- [The Three Bubbles](http://ulaar.wordpress.com/2008/10/25/the-three-bubbles/)
- New Wheels â€“ arranged or love marriage?
- [Three Coincidences](http://ulaar.wordpress.com/2008/10/26/three-coincidences/)
