*Editor's note: My friend Karthik, an avid hiker and a dilettante poet, composed this beauty while on a trek in Kedarkantha just before the pandemic dropped on the world.*

*Another day, another beginning.*   
*Rays of the sun reaching the camp*   
*Giving the snow a delightful glow*   
*After what seemed like an eternity.*   

*Standing in a perfect spot,*   
*I exclaimed, Ah, sunlight!*   
*That's when I noticed you,*   
*Strolling towards me,*  

*Maybe to Steal my little warmth.*   
*Held your head in my arms, *   
*Stroke you like how I would like.*   

*That's when our eyes met.*   
*I felt Warmer like never before.*   

*Little did you know,*   
*You were my Spring in that cold winter day!*
