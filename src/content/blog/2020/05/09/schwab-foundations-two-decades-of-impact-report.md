A few times a year, I Google a few variants of “social enterprise news” with the hope of uncovering new kids on the block or some new social impact report. Measuring social impact is hard. For philanthropic organizations that do things other than direct investing (or give out grants) this is even harder.

Today my Google searches took me to Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship’s *Two Decades of Impact* report (Jan 2020). The foundation is a 22 year old organization with the World Economic Forum as a key partner. Practically all Indian media outlets that covered this report went with the headline *India topmost country for presence of social entrepreneurs* and provided just a few top-level factoids. The rest of this blog post is my attempt to summarize their 55-page PDF report with an India-specific lens.

The foundation supports 400 late-stage social innovators operating in 190+ countries. They support their awardees / member organizations by:

- Raising awareness of their work, giving them significant media exposure
- Gives them access to global networks, world leaders &amp; partners via WEF
- Executive education at the Harvard Kennedy School
- Leadership coaching &amp; mentoring

**Top-level factoids**

- 10 countries in which social entrepreneurs are most active (in descending order): India, USA, Kenya, Brazil, Uganda, South Africa, Mexico, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania
- Top 5 issues: Education, Economic opportunity &amp; development, Entrepreneurship &amp; enterprise development, Health &amp; healthcare, Environment, climate &amp; circular economy
- 622 million people impacted directly
  - Impressive number no doubt but it begs the question “to what degree” (the devil would be in the details of member org reports)
- 17 organizations achieving measurable progress across all [SDGs](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300)

**Karuna Trust** (A personal favorite since I know the founder Dr. Sudarshan)

Since its inception in 1986, Karuna Trust has grown to manage 71 Public Health Centers reaching 1.5 million people. Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) has reduced from 70 to 5 (per 1,000) and Maternal Mortality Rate from 280 to 50 (per 100,000 live births), in Karnataka, achieving 99.9% institutional delivery rate across the state. The Trust addresses 5 SDGs.
