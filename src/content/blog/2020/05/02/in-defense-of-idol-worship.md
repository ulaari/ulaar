A source of controversy and a massive source of division between the major religions that believe in form/idol worship (Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism) and those for whom it is anathema (Christianity, Islam). I found Ramana Maharshiâ€™s response to a Muslim questioner interesting enough to share. The following extract from *[Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi](https://www.amazon.in/Talks-Sri-Ramana-Maharshi-1/dp/8188018074)* Pages 109-110 \[D = Devotee, M = Master\]

*D: Has God a form?*

*M: Who says so?*

*D: Well, if God has no form is it proper to worship idols?*

*M: Leave God alone because He is unknown. What about you? Have you a form?*

*D: Yes. I am this and so and so.*

*M: So then, you are a man with limbs, about three and half cubits high, with beard, etc. Is it so?*

*D: Certainly.*

*M: Then do you find yourself so in deep sleep?*

*D: After waking I perceive that I was asleep. Therefore by inference I remained thus i deep sleep also.*

*M: If you are the body why do they bury the corpse after death? The body must refuse to be buried.*

*D: No, I am the subtle jiva within the gross body.*

*M: So you see that you are really formless; but you are at present identifying yourself with the body. So long as you are formful why should you not worship the formless God as being formful?*

*The questioner was baffled and perplexed.*
