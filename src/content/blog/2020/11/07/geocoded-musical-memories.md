Gratitude journal, related to posts about nostalgia -- because what is a nostalgic post about your past if not an expression of gratitude?

My generation is possibly the last that got most of its music recommendations from friends, family, radio stations,and (in a few cases) eclectic cafes. These _geocoded musical memories_ are etched in my consciousness and this post is a tribute of sorts to folks and venues who introduced the most delightful music at various points in my life. Here I go in chronological order..

 (and esp. that song) – Boris’s CD player

**We didn't start the fire (Hostel 6, BIT Mesra)**
- Billy Joel’s We didn’t start the fire in Puneet Mohan’s hostel room

- My big brother Srinivas: moving from small town Bokaro to big city Madras hostel life in early 80’s meant serious exposure to rock and heavy metal. Lucky me because his next few summer vacations became my immersion into AC/DC, Uriah Heep, Judas Priest, and related luminaries. I’m sure skipping rock and drinking straight from the metal had a positive influence on my life.
- My cousin Swarna: On a visit to Bokaro, she famously remarked “The silence is deafening!” A summer later, in her South Calcutta high-rise apartment, we would understand what she meant. But it was really the summer of 1986 when I (and my sister) were introduced to “pop music”. Wham, Phil Collins, Madonna, and some other female stars. We returned to Bokaro with tapes of No Jacket Required and Wham. Yeah! I know what you are thinking – *Pop after metal*? I’m shaking my head too.
- Jayant (aka Boris) Ramakrishnan: I had to collapse Roger Waters, Rush, cd player,
- Vochak: Jethro Tull, Black Sabbath, and heavy metal
- Shivakumar Raman/classic rock station 107.5?
- Chicago: Larry Dunn, Poonam, Mike Firman
