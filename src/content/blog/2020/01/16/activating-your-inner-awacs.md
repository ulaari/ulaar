![](../../../../uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-9.35.53-PM.png)At some point one starts acting one’s age. I suppose.

In the past year, I can’t recall how many times I’ve come close to yelling “For @#$%$#% sake, increase your goddamn immunity! And, for crying out loud, develop some proprioception!!”

Some folks are born with great immunity while others need to work (a little harder) to acquire them. Immunity is a bit like fitness, in the sense that you can lose it too if you push the limits too much.

But this post was supposed to be about proprioception.

In medical terms, proprioception is the *ability to sense stimuli arising within the body regarding position, motion, and equilibrium*. It’s a concept I first learnt when I began [pitter pattering](http://www.ulaar.com/2012/09/10/my-first-barefoot-run-time-to-pitter-patter/). Turns out, our body comes equipped with other AWACS-like sensors. One such sensor signals the impending aerial onslaught of the bacterial kind.

In my case, my throat gets kinda itchy. When this happens, I swing into corrective action. Two things really:

- Ensure I don’t go below my regulation quota of 7 hours sleep (ideally I go for 8 hours)
- Ingest 1 teaspoon of turmeric mixed into a paste with 1 teaspoon of honey

This works like a charm. All you have to do is activate your inner AWACS.
