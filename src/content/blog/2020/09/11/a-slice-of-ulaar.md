The blog turned 12 in Feb this year. Originally setup as *ulaar.wordpress.com*, I migrated to Wordpress-powered self-hosting on Dreamhost in 2010. A few premium Wordpress theme changes kept things interesting. After my friend Rajeev Singh handily migrated my [other blog](https://www.techsangam.com/2020/08/16/the-great-gatsby/) to Gatsby, it was inevitable that this blog would undergo a similar transformation. 

I've been on a Facebook sabbatical for nearly two years. My Twitter sabbatical is at 10 months although I'll admit that I miss this platform a lot more than FB. The occasional tweetstorm (linked on news articles) is a nostalgic reminder of the pleasures (and time waste) that Twitter can be. Prior to these sabbaticals, I'd share all my blog posts on Twitter but was more selective about what I shared on Facebook. Unsurprisingly, most of my blog readers (and engagement) came from Facebook - Twitter folk can't be bothered with anything that won't fit into a thread. 2000 has been a moderately prolific blogging year - 20 posts in the past 8 months. While my readership had dropped, I continued to derive satisfaction from publishing my posts. When I started using Whatsapp Status to share my posts, engagement grew and, more importantly, reminded me that while reader counts didn't matter to me, the ensuing discussion did. 

So I configured MailChimp to manage email subscriptions on this blog. If you are reading _this post_ on your email client, it means that you are a relative, a BHUKMP runner/alumnus, or have previously engaged with this blog - all in all a distinguished group of initial subscribers numbering less than 100. If you are offended that I took the liberty of adding you to _yet another blog subscription_, fear not -- the frequency is not alarmingly high and the **Unsubscribe** action is just a click away.

Since the article count is approaching 300, I thought to create a _slice of UlaaR_ - a curated list of posts that I enjoyed writing and am _still not ashamed_ of sharing. This latter bit is important -- every post that I published was no doubt worthy of publishing 'at that time'. I now cringe at so many posts, some in the early years (when I was under the illusion that our R2I experience was oh so unique! and some in my rabid running years (when I felt that a race wasn't over until I had provided a blow-by-blow account). But the rules of blogging are clear -- one does NOT go back in time and delete posts!

------------------------------

"He likes running. He likes blogging. But most of all, he likes to blog about running." Pithy words from my wife to a friend in the middle years of this blog. It should then be not a surprise that 100 posts are in the [Running](https://www.ulaar.com/categories/running) category. In [The asthmatic who went up a hill and came down a mountain](https://www.ulaar.com/2020/07/05/the-asthmatic-who-went-up-a-hill-but-came-down-a-mountain/), I write about a 3-week Yamunotri trip that became a game changer. In [vast upper body conspiracy](https://www.ulaar.com/2012/06/14/its-all-a-vast-upper-body-conspiracy/), I had fun telling my transformation-to-a-barefoot-runner story as me eavesdropping on a conversation between a cast of body parts. [I'm racing, not running](https://www.ulaar.com/2016/10/23/racing-not-running/) is all about my standout year of long distance running across KTM, Bangalore Ultra and Mumbai Marathon. In the [yin yank race](https://www.ulaar.com/2017/11/26/yin-yank-race/) I wax eloquent about my Malnad 80k ultra experience.

Considering I turned vegan over 7 years ago and vocal about my choice in my offline interactions, I haven't blogged much about it. [The imperfect vegan](https://www.ulaar.com/2019/12/20/the-imperfect-vegan/) is that rare post in the evolving [Food](https://www.ulaar.com/categories/food) category. [Adventures in buffet optimization](https://www.ulaar.com/2018/06/10/adventures-in-buffet-optimization/) is a paean to my gastronomic years in US covering the gamut of Indian food, pizzas, and burritos.  

Maximizing (as a theme) is a thing of the past for me. In [I don't need...](https://www.ulaar.com/2014/01/24/i-dont-need/), I make all kinds of sanctimonious declarations that (shockingly) I still don't seem to need. In [minimalist in a maximal world](https://www.ulaar.com/2015/04/05/minimalist-in-a-maximal-world/) I expound on my views on minimalism and why it has captured my imagination. [Digital Visarjan](https://www.ulaar.com/2020/01/04/digital-visarjan/) chronicles my running stats tracking progression from the Garmin Forerunner to a digital watch to the Nike Running App to.. nothing. 

There's no doubt that becoming a long distance runner kicked off a virtuous circle in my life. What it did not do however is "fix my asthma". When this finally hit home, I went looking for answers with a _siddha_ doctor -- which ultimately gave me the formula for [getting healthy the slow way](https://www.ulaar.com/2019/12/15/getting-healthy-the-slow-way/). Since I alluded to Twitter nostalgia, I must end with [when a tweet triggered a hormesis habit change](https://www.ulaar.com/2019/12/02/when-a-tweet-triggered-a-hormesis-habit-change/) - switching to cold showers in Jan 2009 and not looking back.
