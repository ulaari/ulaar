We are in Vijayawada (Andhra Pradesh) at my parentsâ€™ house for the holidays. This is my fifth trip since my parents moved here in 1994 and is easily the most enjoyable trip to date. My grandfatherâ€™s banking career was spent at Andhra Bank and Central Bank. He was getting transferred to new towns every few years so my dadâ€™s family moved a lot. Turns out a significant chunk of time was spent in Vijayawada. I pestered my dad to take me around town and show me important landmarks like the houses they lived in and the schools they went to. He obliged and we had 2 fun hours zig-zagging through some old neighbourhoods of Vijayawada. Here is a pictorial view of the Kuruganti roots in Vijayawada:

(**Ram Mohan Reading Library** - my dad was a fixture from 1951 to 1953. Side note: in Feb 1952, my dad met his spiritual guru at a lecture on the first floor.)

(**Bala Krishna Bhavan in One Town Vijayawada** - dadâ€™s family rented a few rooms on the top floor in the 1950â€™s)

(**My dad in front of his old classroom.** The school had a rather â€˜interestingâ€™ tradition where the academic topper got to slap the rest of his classmates. Fortunately (for my dad) he was on the right end of those slaps ðŸ™‚)

(**Renowned Ayurvedic practitioner Nori Rama Sastryâ€™s Office** was right next to the previous rental building. On an impulse, we went inside the office and met the Ayurvedic greatâ€™s grandson and his great-grandson who were both very hospitable.)
