We hit our ‚Äòone year anniversary in India‚Äô on India‚Äôs Independence Day ‚Äì Aug 15, 2009. A few months ago, we toyed with the idea of throwing a party and invite all our friends (old and new). The unrelenting pressures of work and the weekly ‚Äòrhythm of the kids‚Äô school and after-school activities meant we would alter our plans. ‚Äôtwas all for the good anyway. It was more appropriate to celebrate the anniversary as a quiet [Thanksgiving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving)-style dinner with family than a raucous party.

I did tweet about it though (and gave ourselves a B+ grade) ‚Äì and our global social graph responded enthusiastically. There‚Äôs much to write about our experience but here are a few top reasons why we are rating our ‚Äòmove to India‚Äô a solid B+ (knock-on wood for each bullet point):

- Fortunate enough that none of us (especially the kids) have fallen seriously ill
- Children getting sensitized to the global issues of haves and have-nots
- Adapted to the local environment and enjoying the spectrum of people and experiences
- Kids are well-settled at their new school ‚Äì NPS Koramangala
- My job at Adobe has been every bit as exciting and rewarding as I had hoped a year ago
- We met my parents thrice and my brother five times in the past year, not to mention the increased ‚Äòcalling-to-Vijayawada‚Äô frequency thanks to the same timezone
- Met and made friends with many wonderful folks at Raheja Residency
- Asthma hasn‚Äôt reared its ugly head so far.. (Read [Asthma, Bangalore and me](http://ulaar.wordpress.com/2008/08/29/asthma-bangalore-and-me/) for background)
- Becoming a regular part of the Cubbon Park Irregulars (a rabid group of enthusiastic group of long distance runners) has meant that I ran my first half-marathon in Jan 2009 and very likely will run my second marathon next weekend at [Kaveri Trail Marathon](http://www.kaveritrailmarathon.com)
- Graduated from a chauffeur-driven car to self-driven car at the 7-month mark

The challenge a part-time blogger always faces is time ‚Äì rather the lack thereof. The list of unwritten blogs continues to balloon every month. Partly to reduce my guilt at disappointing my small but loyal base of readers and partly to get feedback on which topics might be of more interest, here‚Äôs the complete list (in no particular order):

- [Bangalore Calling](http://ulaar.wordpress.com/2008/12/14/bangalore-calling/): This was meant to be the sequel to [The Bombay Seduction](http://ulaar.wordpress.com/2008/06/12/the-bombay-seduction/) and [Gurgaon Growling](http://ulaar.wordpress.com/2009/06/18/gurgaon-growling/) but this post was threatening to eternally remain in the ‚ÄúDraft‚Äù folder. As a stop-gap, I pasted a relevant conversation with a New Jersey-based Indian-American contemplating a return
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Indian Woman‚Äôs Dilemna</span>: Someday this post will be written by my wife. The thesis is that an Indian woman has a LOT more freedom in America than in her own native country. How then does she reconcile the pros and cons in her head in order to arrive at the decision to return to India?
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Raheja ‚ÄòMonkey-Haven‚Äô Residency</span>: When I informed my Bangalore-native classmate &amp; friend (who lives in the Bay Area) about our new coordinates in Koramangala, he remarked, in a disappointed tone I might add, ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs a fairly mainstream choice‚Äù (He‚Äôd have approved if we had taken residence at the Adarsh Palm Meadows.) Anyway, the demographic profile of Raheja, its vibrant community and its killer location made it an easy choice for us. One of the many fringe benefits of living in Raheja: hardly a week goes by without sighting a pack of monkeys scaling the walls of the buildings foraging for food.
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Of high rises and balconies</span>: You may not realize it but high rise apartment buildings and their numerous balconies are perilous to kids (and to parents with weak hearts). Our own apartment hunt had to rebooted after our 3 year old demonstrated that the 5th floor balcony is eminently climbable (we still shudder thinking back to that scene).
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vishnu‚Äôs Best Devotee</span>: This has nothing to do with our move but I had an epiphany on work-life balance as I recollected one of Narada‚Äôs tales.
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Crowd-sourcing the traffic light</span>: I could possibly write 3-4 different posts on Indian road traffic but this is the one I really want to. The unmanned Indian traffic intersection is a fascinating and efficient system. Unmanned intersection and efficient? (you snort) In much the same way that the Mumbai dabbawalas have demonstrated their world-class efficiency, crowd-sourcing the traffic light (which is how I‚Äôve dubbed the unmanned traffic intersection) is simply brilliant for Indian traffic conditions.
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Staring Gene</span>: Why do Indians stare so much? I‚Äôm not talking about Indian kids nor am I talking about Indians gawking at foreign tourists or celebrities ‚Äì these are somewhat understandable. I‚Äôm talking about Indians staring at Indians‚Ä¶
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Midnight Marathon to Kaveri Trail Marathon</span>: This is a tribute post to my Runners for Life and Cubbon Park Irregulars friends who‚Äôre transforming me from a hobbyist occasionally-goal-directed runner to a semi-pro obsessive runner.
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do not urinate here</span>: Saw this painted on a wall in Warangal (or was it Hyderabad?) The location doesn‚Äôt really matter because there are very few walls that are sacred in India (even those that are close to temples). Why is that we are not seeing the number of Sulabh Shauchalays increase in India? Why are restrooms an afterthought in most commercial buildings? When they do exist, why are soaps noticeable by their absence? Is it a wonder that infectious diseases continue to have a field day in India?
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Excellent products, Poor Services</span>: The former are driven by market economy, the latter due to unchanged mindset? My wife and I slightly disagree on the latter. I hold the hope that the market can drive higher level of service and competitors would be forced to catch-up but my wife thinks the attitudes are too deep-seated.
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Living in the Present</span>: \[essay from wife\]
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Well-rounded education</span>: \[essay from wife\]
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Three Bubbles Revisited</span>: An expansion on the original[ The Three Bubbles](http://ulaar.wordpress.com/2008/10/25/the-three-bubbles/) post ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs my friend Pranshu (who goes offroading every weekend in Gurgaon) or the guy in Mumbai (who goes mountain-biking) or me reconnecting with my inner-running-self and looking-forward to resuming my squash routine, there are additional ways of enriching the ‚Äòliving bubble‚Äô.
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What I miss about California</span>
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Close encounters of the bribing kind</span>: Two encounters so far and I passed with flying colors.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">  
  </span>
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What I don‚Äôt like about India</span>: inspired by a recent Starbucks chat with a friend who mildly accused me of writing only positive things about our move. Not true my friend. You should read my tweets more carefully üôÇ<span style="text-decoration: underline;">  
  </span>
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(No) Thank You Maids</span>: \[essay from wife\] Cheap labor, poor performance, excellent excuse for the Indianization of the Indian-American male.
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desperate Lives</span>: Whether it‚Äôs the maid or the driver or the handyman or the kackra-wala, they are all living incredibly difficult and desperate lives to make ends meet.
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Educating Boys</span>: \[essay from wife\] School + sports = incomplete; Home + school + sports = complete. Her thesis is that the top reason why more Indian women are not able to join the workforce is because the men are incapable of managing the household.
- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Global Identity</span>: \[essay from wife\] 1992 -&gt; Indian looks, American thinking, Indian feelings; 2009 -&gt; Indian looks, American thinking, Indian-American feelings (hypersensitive vs. tempered)
- Piracy in DVD rentals
- Sequel to [The Janus Man](http://ulaar.wordpress.com/2009/07/17/the-janus-man/)
