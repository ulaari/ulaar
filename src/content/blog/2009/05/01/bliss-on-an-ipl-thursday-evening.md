April 30 started off as a pretty ordinary Thursday. Left for work at the usual time, left the office at 5:30 pm, and picked up the kids from Vivaa International. Thursdays are ‘swimming class off’ days for S, which meant it was bicycling time for both the kids. The exciting Delhi Daredevils vs. Deccan Chargers match was in progress so I persuaded the kids to cut short their cycling routine and we headed up to the apartment. Some Raheja cultural function was in progress which usually means that a pani puri/bhel puri stand magically appears near the club house. The family swung into an impromptu plan of entertainment for the evening (pani puris were calling out to us). Finished seeing the tail end of Deccan’s batting (Dwayne Smith hit a quickfire 48), gave the kids their bath and headed to Anand Sweets. P and I alternately got our pani-puri fix (btw, eating pani-puris solo is a lot more intense compared to a round-robin group experience). The kids got to pick their favorite sweet which they demolished in no time. Then off we went to Cafe Wisdom Lounge to pick up a big order of aloo parathas, gobi parathas and paneer parathas. We managed to reach home shortly after 8pm – just in time for match #22 (Chennai Superkings vs. Rajasthan Royals). We parked ourselves on the living room floor in front of the TV and started devouring the parathas and watched in awe as Suresh Raina put in a flawless dominating batting performance. The kids got to see the match until 9pm (later than their usual bed time but hey.. this was a special weekday evening). It’s season 2 of IPL and the Kuruganti family (including the kids) are loving it – Thursday evening was particularly blissful.
