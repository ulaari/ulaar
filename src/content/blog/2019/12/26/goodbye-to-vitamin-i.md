Earlier this year I had written about [unlocking a superpower](http://www.ulaar.com/2019/05/04/unlocking-a-superpower/), a post that tantalizingly starts with me ‘visualizing away’ a raging headache, a feat that sadly turns out to be a one-time wonder.

If you have Googled, you know that there is no such thing as Vitamin **I**. But if you’ve read the thoroughly engaging and deeply inspiring [Eat and Run](https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Run-Unlikely-Ultramarathon-Greatness/dp/0544002318/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=eat+and+run&qid=1577120613&sr=8-1), you would know that Vitamin I is the affectionate moniker coined by Dusty Olsen for everyday painkiller Ibuprofen. Who is Dusty? Scott Jurek’s longtime pacing/crewing buddy of course. Scott Jurek is of course [this guy](http://www.scottjurek.com/).

I’ve struggled with headaches for most of my adult life but have learned to live with it. Some combination of Tiger Balm and Anacin-&gt;Advil-&gt;Brufen would usually engender a return to normalcy.

A new type afflicted me after I started logging 25k+ weekend runs in Bangalore – the post-run headache After multiple hydration experiments, coconut water turned out to be the winning antidote. I must have eventually developed some kind of immunity because I stopped the antidote a year later and my post-run headaches didn’t return.

So it was back to those pesky 1-2 times a month ‘regular’ headaches.

Things took a serendipitous turn in May 2013. I was in Bhopal to guest blog the World Bank’s [Development Marketplace](http://www.techsangam.com/2013/05/29/world-bank-india-development-marketplace-finalist-review-part-1/) event. One of the finalists was Ashish Gawade, whose [BOPEEI](http://www.techsangam.com/2011/08/11/bopeei-generating-off-grid-electricity-in-cloudy-and-coastal-regions/) social enterprise I had written about earlier.

Ashish, also a volunteer with [Manashakti](https://www.manashakti.org/), shared an interesting theory about pain:

- that physical pain is a reaction to some abuse we have inflicted on our body, and
- that the only way to permanently recover is to *acknowledge* it, *endure* it (and certainly *no managing the pain*)

In a way I was primed for this prescription after reading about Jurek’s many exploits one of which involved *racing a brutal trail ultra on a bum ankle without Vitamin I*!

A new experiment was born – goodbye to Vitamin I, at any cost!

Oh boy! This was one hard and painful experiment. But I stuck it to it gamely for 3-4 years before the recidivistic impulse felled me. And when I did come off the streak, my pain tolerance had increased significantly so I’d pop the Vitamin I once, say every 5 episodes.

P.S. If you are a runner, you absolutely read [Chronicles of a Dustball](https://trailrunnermag.com/people/chronicles-of-a-dustball.html), a paean to the amazing Dusty Olson.
