We’ve all had tough bosses in our careers. I don’t know about you but I’ve always enjoyed working with them. Just to be clear, folks like Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, or fictional fashion editor Miranda Priestley are NOT my definition of tough boss. I’m talking about the boss that sets a really high bar, pushes you to hurtle towards BHAGs and (this is the most important trait) is *not a jerk*.

Recently, a colleague articulated the ***tough boss framework*** in a really succinct way. This is how SG described it.

1. First of all, you need to *know your stuff* (stuff = domain expertise)
2. Secondly, you need to *put in the effort* (effort = BHAG level)
3. Finally, if shit hits the ceiling (i.e. “something unexpected happens”), the boss has your back because of #1 and #2.

So simple. Thanks SG.
