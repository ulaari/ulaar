As a tribute to this post’s theme, I’m *just* going to share excerpts of this not-so-famous 2006 book. As opposed to providing a commentary on what this topic means to me.

> For obvious reasons, it’s entirely appropriate that a book entitled [The Underachiever’s Manifesto](http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FThe-Underachievers-Manifesto-Accomplishing-Feeling%2Fdp%2F0811853683&sref=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/may/18/underachieving-column-change-life-oliver-burkeman) never really became a huge seller. Written by an American doctor named Ray Bennett – not the kind of doctor whom I’d necessarily want if I had a life-threatening illness – it vanished soon after its debut, in 2006. Now, though, its publishers have finally got it together to release it as an ebook in Britain, so you can download it. *I mean, if you like. Don’t push yourself. After all, you’re already doing great*<span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> As Bennett himself points out, *“Being alive is by far your greatest achievement.”*
> 
> Subtitled *The Guide To Accomplishing Little And Feeling Great*, Bennett’s short treatise seems at first like another of those jokey-but-unfunny gift books they sold by the tills at Borders, back before Borders itself stopped achieving. But it soon becomes clear there’s more to it. *“The achievement lobby is powerful,” he notes early on, “and underachievement is, surprisingly, not as easy as it should be*. Our world is so full of unrelenting messages about being the best you can be that it may not even have occurred to you to try for anything less.” Yet “how many careers are coupled with disastrous marriages? How many talented, hard-working people smoke too much \[and\] exercise too little… How many fitness-crazed \[people\] tear up their knees running marathons?” Underachievement, the way Bennett uses the term, begins to seem less like an appealing option for the lazy-minded and more like a path to a superior kind of achievement.

The author of this book? One Dr. Ray Bennett from the Seattle area
