When I turned vegan ~6 years ago, my conformance was slightly less than 100% initially. This was largely to keep domestic peace without compromising the core principle. For example,

- *Palak paneer*, a popular dish when dining out, couldn’t be messed with. So I’d focus on the palak while they’d monopolize the paneer
- While eating at home, I’d occasionally get a ghee smeared roti thanks to miscalculation by one of the boys
- It was incredibly hard for my boys to process why I’d refuse even a small piece of cheese pizza or milk shake. So I obliged for a few birthdays

For most of my life, chocolate didn’t hold a special place in my heart but living with this family (especially in the past 10 years) has inexorably changed that. I *finally* get why chocolate is a big deal to so many people. While I restrict myself to dark chocolate and I don’t succumb easily, milk solids are involved in any non-vegan chocolate so there… I’ll probably return to 100% in due course but I’m not losing sleep over it. 

As I track the amazing progress of the vegan movement (in Europe, US, and shockingly closer to home in India), I’ve started asking this question: ***Could the imperfect vegan be better for the world than the perfect vegetarian with a high dairy chowprint?*** The following tweets are illustrative:

I find myself vigorously agreeing with Kaitlin – **better to have a world full of non-strict vegans than a small percentage of the world fully vegan**.
