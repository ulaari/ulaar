"I think you should change your name to Vic."
The recruiter had completed a quick scan of my resume and the first helpful suggestion she offered was that I change my name.

I smiled at her and said "My official name is Vishwanath and since that's a whopping 3 syllables, I'm using the name my friends call me. Isn't Vishy easy enough?"
"Well, it's not hard.. but it's not American. Vic will be easier."
I said "Hmmm.." and walked away.
