When I give my 2-minute elevator pitch about TechSangam to friends or acquaintances, I usually follow-up with the question “Do you know what social enterprises are?”  The answer invariably is “No.”  The only other term with a lower aided awareness is ‘impact investing’ . Heck! I first heard the term during this year’s [Sankalp Forum](../2011/05/09/if-i-was-looking-for-inspiration-i-found-it-at-sankalp-forum/) and quipped on Twitter – Is there any kind of investing that does NOT look for impact?

Once you spell out *impact* *investing* as ***social impact* *investing***, most people get it. For my friends new to this space, I define impact investing as the type of investing that lies between venture investing and philanthropy. If one were to map investors on a spectrum, philanthropists and traditional venture capitalists would be found on opposite ends with social impact investors (aka *impact investors*) somewhere in the middle. Philanthropists write cheques purely for social impact while venture capitalists invest in companies primarily for financial returns – any resulting social impact is incidental and considered a ‘bonus’ . In some extreme cases (think SKS Microfinance/Sequoia), social impact can even ‘get in the way’  of financial returns.

This brings us to the thin sliver of impact investors. An impact investor invests in social enterprises with the dual expectation of social impact and financial returns. Since social enterprises, by definition, are striving for success on two dimensions, it should not surprise us that their financial returns would, for the most part, be lower than classic startup ventures that are maximizing only for financial returns. In an earlier post ([Thoughts on philanthropy disruption](../2011/05/13/thoughts-on-philanthropy-disruption/)), I’ve opined that i’s easier to transform philanthropists (than venture capitalists) into impact investors.

I’m now going to burst your bubble and state that the impact investing landscape in India is quite bleak! While there’s a lot of talk about new impact investors entering the Indian ecosystem, I’m aware of just <del>six</del> <del>eight</del> <del>fourteen</del> eighteen institutional impact investors.

1. [Aavishkaar](http://www.aavishkaar.in/): The grand-daddy of Indian social investors has two separate funds. The Micro Equity Fund ($14 million) operational since May 2002.

Already made 20+ investments (short list: Milk Mantra, [Vaatsalya](../2011/06/20/vaatsalya-affordable-high-quality-healthcare-formula-smaller-towns/), Vortex Engineering, Waterlife Foundation, GV Meditech, Rangsutra, Zameen Organic, B2R Technologies, Saraplast).
