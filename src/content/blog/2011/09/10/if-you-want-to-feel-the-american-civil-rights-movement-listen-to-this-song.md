**Mississippi Goddam by Nina Simone**

By Nina Simone’s own admission, this was her first civil rights song. It was inspired by the murder of four girls in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church on 15 September 1963 by members of the Ku Klux Klan. It is, by far, one of the most powerful protest songs of the time… Lyrics of the song below but you really ought to go listen to this song.

> The name of this tune is Mississippi Goddam
> 
> And I mean every word of it
> 
> Alabama’s gotten me so upset  
> Tennessee made me lose my rest  
> And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam
> 
> Alabama’s gotten me so upset  
> Tennessee made me lose my rest  
> And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam
> 
> Can’t you see it  
> Can’t you feel it  
> It’s all in the air  
> I can’t stand the pressure much longer  
> Somebody say a prayer
> 
> Alabama’s gotten me so upset  
> Tennessee made me lose my rest  
> And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam
> 
> This is a show tune  
> But the show hasn’t been written for it, yet
> 
> Hound dogs on my trail  
> School children sitting in jail  
> Black cat cross my path  
> I think every day’s gonna be my last
> 
> Lord have mercy on this land of mine  
> We all gonna get it in due time  
> I don’t belong here  
> I don’t belong there  
> I’ve even stopped believing in prayer
> 
> Don’t tell me  
> I tell you  
> Me and my people just about due  
> I’ve been there so I know  
> They keep on saying “Go slow!”
> 
> But that’s just the trouble  
> “do it slow”  
> Washing the windows  
> “do it slow”  
> Picking the cotton  
> “do it slow”  
> You’re just plain rotten  
> “do it slow”  
> You’re too damn lazy  
> “do it slow”  
> The thinking’s crazy  
> “do it slow”  
> Where am I going  
> What am I doing  
> I don’t know  
> I don’t know
> 
> Just try to do your very best  
> Stand up be counted with all the rest  
> For everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam
> 
> I bet you thought I was kiddin’, didn’t you
> 
> Picket lines  
> School boy cots  
> They try to say it’s a communist plot  
> All I want is equality  
> for my sister my brother my people and me
> 
> Yes you lied to me all these years  
> You told me to wash and clean my ears  
> And talk real fine just like a lady  
> And you’d stop calling me Sister Sadie
> 
> Oh but this whole country is full of lies  
> You’re all gonna die and die like flies  
> I don’t trust you anymore  
> You keep on saying “Go slow!”  
> “Go slow!”
> 
> But that’s just the trouble  
> “do it slow”  
> Desegregation  
> “do it slow”  
> Mass participation  
> “do it slow”  
> Reunification  
> “do it slow”  
> Do things gradually  
> “do it slow”  
> Will bring more tragedy  
> “do it slow”  
> Why don’t you see it  
> Why don’t you feel it  
> I don’t know  
> I don’t know
> 
> You don’t have to live next to me  
> Just give me my equality  
> Everybody knows about Mississippi  
> Everybody knows about Alabama  
> Everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam
