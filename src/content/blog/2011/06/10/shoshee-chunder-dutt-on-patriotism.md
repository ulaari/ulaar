<div class="poem">*Heard ye that lofty pealing sound*  
*⁠Upon the balmy air,*  
*The exulting shout that best proclaims*  
*⁠The deeds which heroes dare?*  
  
*In triumph blow their trumpets proud,*  
*⁠The clouds repeat their voice;*  
*Go, greet the laurell’d victors home,*  
*⁠And bid our realms rejoice.*  
  
*Let poets tune their golden harps,*  
*⁠Let maidens wear their smile,*  
*And young and old their cares lay by,*  
*⁠And cease to mourn awhile.*  
  
*What! hear’st thou not their joyous din?*  
*⁠Behold, above the vale,*  
*Their haughty plumes and ensigns red*  
*⁠Are fluttering in the gale;*

</div><div class="poem">*And helmets cleft, and canvas torn,*  
*⁠Proclaim the fighting done;*  
*And neighing steeds, and bloody spears,*  
*⁠Announce the battle won.*  
  
*Alas! the vision mocks my sight;*  
*⁠I see no gallant throng,*  
*No trophies meet my longing eyes;*  
*⁠Bid cease the joyous song.*  
  
*That recreant slave is not my lord;*  
*⁠Ne’er thus the brave return;*  
*Go, bid the city-gates be barr’d,*  
*⁠And leave me lone to mourn.*  
  
*I know him not, I never knew*  
*⁠A low, ignoble love;*  
*My warrior sleeps upon the moor,*  
*⁠His soul hath soar’d above.*  
  
*Upon the battle-field he lies,*  
*⁠His garments stain’d with gore;*  
*With sword in hand prepared he sleeps*  
*⁠To fight the battle o’er.*  
  
*His shiver’d shield, his broken spear,*  
*⁠Around him scatter’d lie;*  
*The iron-breasted Moslems shook*  
*⁠To see my hero die.*  
  
*Where helmets rang, where sabres smote,*  
*⁠He found his gory bed;*  
*Join, mourners, join, and loudly raise*  
*⁠The requiem of the dead.*  
  
*Expel yon vile impostor hence;*  
*⁠I will not trust his tale;*  
*Our warriors on the crimson field*  
*⁠Their chieftain’s loss bewail.*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

</div>*The mountain torrent rushing down*

*Can ne’er its course retrace,*

*And souls that speed on glory’s path*

*Must ever onward press:*

*Aye, onward press — to bleed and die,*

*Triumphant still in death:*

*Imposter, hence! in other lands*

*Go draw thy coward breath.*

**May 2020 update**: in my original post, I had only included the last 2 paragraphs of The Warrior Returns.
