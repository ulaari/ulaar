A friend alerted me to [Gapminder.org](http://www.gapminder.org/) a while ago and today I finally sampled some of their amazing datasets via their nifty Trendalyzer. If you haven’t heard of Gapminder, their mission statement should catch your attention:

> *Fighting the most devastating myths by building a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fact-based world view</span> that everyone understands.*

Their website describes Gapminder as a non-profit venture â€“ a modern â€œmuseumâ€  on the Internet â€“ promoting sustainable global development and achievement of the [United Nations Millennium Development Goals](http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/). Expressed more tersely, Gapminder is a “fact tank” (think “think tanks”).

Anyway, I picked four datasets relevant to this blog with a sufficiently long time series to make them interesting. The interactive graphics on the Gapminder Trendalyzer are fun to view so I’ve linked the original Gapminder interactive graph from the screenshots. Since it’s more fun to compare trends with a similarly large country (in terms of population), I’m using China for that purpose.
