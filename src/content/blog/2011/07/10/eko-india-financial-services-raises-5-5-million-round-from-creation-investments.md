We had written about Eko Financial Services in a two-part series (Part 1 [linked here](http://www.techsangam.com/2011/05/01/khata-kholo-har-darwaza-kholo-ekos-branchless-banking-part-1/)). Today they are announcing the closing of a $5.5 million funding round from Creation Investments, a Chicago-based social ventures fund. I had a chat with Abhishek Sinha (Eko co-Founder &amp; CEO) soon after their funding closed and he shared some other exciting news as well – the noteworthy detail being that they expect to become profitable a lot earlier than previously planned. Will make a follow-up post on that. Meanwhile, here’s the complete press release from Eko/Creation Investments.

> New Delhi, India, July 9, 2011.Â Creation Investments Social Ventures Fund I (â€œCISVFâ€ ), a US based private equity fund, led a $5.5 million USD growth equity investment into Eko India Financial Services Private Limited (“Eko” ), a leading Business Correspondent (“BC” ) and mobile banking technology provider in India.
> 
> Through its robust mobile-based platform and 1,300 agents, Eko provides its customers with basic banking, savings and payment services, along with merchant transactions, bill payment, and cash collection services. Eko’s solution allows customers to open bank accounts, deposit, withdraw and remit money in real-time at the agent using number dialing from any mobile phone. Through its branchless banking service offering and integration with India’s largest banks, Eko empowers the unbanked in India to access financial services and transact with over 250 million bank accounts.
> 
> As a technology provider, Eko supports other Business Correspondents, including Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), extending their outreach and product offering. Business Correspondents have used Eko’s solution due to its real-time connectivity to State Bank of India’s core banking system, the ubiquity of access, near zero start-up CAPEX for the agent, low client literacy requirements, and proven product design.
> 
> We are thrilled to have partnered with the strong management team of Eko, providing further human and financial capital to assist in scaling their exceptional product offering. We believe that Eko has best-in-class technology which gives easy, secure, inexpensive and convenient last-mile connectivity to the unbanked, migrant workers and the poor, said Patrick Fisher, CEO and Co-Founder of Creation Investments.
> 
> The $5.5 million USD in growth equity was raised jointly by Creation Investments Capital Management, LLC and Promus Equity Partners, LLC from a consortium of high net worth investors and a core investment from CISVF, closing in June 2011. The capital raised will be used to fund the growth of Eko’s mobile banking platform and agent footprint, facilitating deeper financial inclusion and outreach to the unbanked and under-banked in India.
> 
> In Creation Investments, we believe we have found an extremely valuable partner, who is aligned to our values and committed to working with us to achieve our ambitious growth plans,  said Abhishek Sinha, Co-founder and CEO of Eko.
