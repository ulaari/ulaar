My first reaction on seeing this ([Top 100 Social Enterprise Truths](http://popse.wordpress.com/2011/05/13/the-100-social-enterprise-truths/)) post from Pop-Up Social Enterprise Think Tank’s: *What! Are there so many*? My second reaction, halfway through my perusal: *No way are people going to go through the entire list*! And my third/last reaction after I reviewed the entire list: *Hmm… Interesting! Several resonated, a few were plain funny, and I didn’t care for a few*. My journey in discovering and writing about Indian social entrepreneurship has been brief, yet I succumb to a temptation to create my curated subset of aphorisms. In my first curation pass, I created a list of twenty-five, then iteratively whittled it down to fifteen. Instead of force-fitting it down further to a typical Top-10, I sorted the list such that the first ten are my true Top 10 and the remaining five are probably more truisms than aphorisms.

1\. Even if you call them a client, an end-user or beneficiary, the customer is still king.

2\. More-than-profit is better than not-for-profit (profitâ€™s not a dirty word).

3\. Social entrepreneurship isnâ€™t a career, itâ€™s a calling (do something before you take the label).

4\. Edison was right (1% inspiration, 99% perspiration).

5\. Donâ€™t scale up before the modelâ€™s proven, however much noise &amp; encouragement there is.

6\. Social entrepreneursâ€™ work has a ripple effect: mobilizing and inspiring others to get involved.

7\. Social enterprises overestimate what they can achieve in the short-term, and underestimate it in the long-term.

8\. Underpromise and overdeliver: all too rare in social enterprise.

9\. Imperfect action is almost always better than perfect inaction.

10\. A three-year government contract is no more sustainable than a three-year grant.

\[11.\] Scale of impact is more important than scale of organization (or scale of ego).

\[12.\] Thereâ€™s more truth spoken over drinks and meals at a conference than on the stage.

\[13.\] Measuring social impact is where financial reporting was 200 years ago (so donâ€™t beat yourself up).

\[14.\] Beware the *self-styled* social entrepreneur; normally means itâ€™s more about *self* and *style*.

\[15.\] If a pound was donated each time a social entrepreneur quoted Gandhi, no-one would need to fundraise.
