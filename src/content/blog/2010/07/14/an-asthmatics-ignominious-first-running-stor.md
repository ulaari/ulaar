I had originally posted this story in my Xaviers Bokaro alumni mailing list back in Sep 2006. If you’ve read the post [Running the Course – Mumbai Marathon 2010](https://www.ulaar.com/2010/02/14/running-the-course-mumbai-marathon-2010/) and are wondering about the back story to my running fetish, this story might offer some clues. I made a few minor edits to the email, anonymized the identity of my two classmates (A and C below), and tweaked the ending based on a recent recollection. Loreto house (blue) and Carmel house (yellow) are two of the four sports houses of St. Xaviers Bokaro.

![](../../../../uploads/2010/07/haile_gebrselassie_topnews_in.jpeg) Haile Gebrselassie - a marathon legend who still needs to battle asthma

*For those of you that remember me, I was rarely (if ever) seen on the athletic field. I had a bad case of asthma during my formative years. Anyway, that’s my excuse and I’m sticking to it.* *During the 8th or 9th Standard, my loyalty towards Loreto house reached epic proportions and I decided to participate in the only sports event that didn’t require selection or qualification – the venerable cross-country race. Never mind that I’d never run a distance longer than 5m before. Outfitted with a freshly-dusted pair of tennis shoes (*[*keds*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keds_(shoes))*, if we must be accurate), blue singlet, shorts and an ardent fervor in my heart, I stepped on to the field. If I had had seen [Chariots of Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariots_of_Fire), its music would have been resonating in my head. In reality, what I sorely needed was an albuterol inhaler to combat my asthma. I crouched at the race start with two equally loyal Loreto compatriots – A and C.*

*The gun went off and behold my dismay when I saw the entire crowd “take off” (or so it seemed). I was thinking to myself, this is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cross-country</span> race (for crying out loud!) – why are they running so fast already? I calmed myself down and decided to stick to my plan of “pacing” the race (having a scant little clue how long the race was). Lucky for me, my dear buddy A was giving me company as we brought up the sparsely populated rear guard.*

*As a token of my gratitude, I entertained A with the rhythmic music that only tortured asthmatic lungs can produce. I think C must have raced ahead because I don’t recall seeing him after the starter gun went off. Anyway, after an eternity and thousand deaths, we completed the trail segment of the race and reached the entrance to the school field – the final 400meter beckoned to us. At that crucial stage, a couple of things happened..*

- A began to break free (his 2nd wind probably?) leaving me in sole possession of last place.
- I heard Voice#1 from the sidelines “Quick! you are almost there! Just 400 meters more!”.
- Then I heard Voice#2 from the sidelines “I think they award points only to runners who finish within \[X\] minutes!”

*Ultimately the combination of voice#2 and A’s late burst was too much for my tender nerves to bear. I was probably fine completing the “victory lap” jointly with A but I could not withstand the ignominy of being in sole possession of last place. I had no Garmin (or even a regular watch) so I had no way of knowing how close to the cutoff I was. So I did the dastardly act of throwing in the towel thus leaving A in sole possession of last place. Dear A, I’m sorry for denying you the ‘official’ last-but-one spot! But at least you got Loreto house <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span>* *extra point.*

*Unfortunately, there’s a final sad twist to the story. That was the year Loreto house tied for 3rd place in the overall standings with Carmel house! Had I completed the race and secured an additional point, Loreto would have been in sole possession of 3rd place. I recall C being very sore on this point and guilted me on several occasions “had you got that one point, Loreto would have…”*

Shame is temporary. Quitting is permanent! (Not sure who said this)
