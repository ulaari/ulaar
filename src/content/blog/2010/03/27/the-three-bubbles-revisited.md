When I wrote [The Three Bubbles](https://ulaar.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&post=177) back in Oct 2008, the perspective was biased around *cushioning the India landing*. Clearly the 3 bubbles represent a fairly minimalistic view of life. If one were to just shuttle from the ‚Äúliving bubble‚Äù to the ‚Äúworking bubble‚Äù via the ‚Äúcommuting bubble‚Äù, there‚Äôs a strong likelihood of slowly going mad‚Ä¶ unless you are one of the workaholic types who‚Äôs all-consumed by work. For the rest of us, a fourth bubble is what the the *joie de vivre* doctor ordered.

The fourth bubble is an activity you do at least once a week, usually on weekends, and is something that delivers large doses of joy, pleasure, and exhilaration. Physical pain may be a side effect sometimes but..(heck) it would have been worth it. Lest the hyperactive imagination of my readers go off in strange directions, let me cut to the chase and elaborate on what I‚Äôm talking about üôÇ

Pranshu Gupta (buddy and ex-colleague from Yahoo who returned to Delhi in 2002) spends weekends offroading his custom-fitted Jeep up-and-down steep ravines and sloshing through muddy swamps on the outskirts of Gurgaon. For company, he has 8-10 other folks vying with each for bragging rights on offroading adventures, jeep modifications and towing equipment. For a taste of what these guys do with whinnying machines, check out [Offroading in Behrampur/Gurgaon](http://ulaar.wordpress.com/2009/09/21/offroading-in-behrampur-gurgaon-selected-shorts/).

Soumya Banerjee (who returned to Delhi from Boston in 2001 to start Sapient‚Äôs India operation and is now working on a startup in Mumbai) is a thoroughbred wanderlust who doesn‚Äôt let a single weekend go by without exploring yet another picturesque part of India. After experiencing the best of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh (during his Delhi days), he‚Äôs now busy exploring Maharashtra and the southern states. For photographic evidence, check out his travel blog at [Soumya.org](http://soumya.org) ‚Äì be warned! the travel bug might bite you.

Manjula Sridhar (a budding entrepreneur and endurance athlete who returned to Bangalore from Silicon Valley) has a menu of endurance activities to choose from every weekend ‚Äì from running to cycling to ‚ÄúLost-style‚Äù adventure competitions. I kid you not! This gal chalks up cycling and running miles like‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what to compare her with. As though this were not enough, she‚Äôs also a trained martial artist and she teaches karate. Clearly she has conquered time.

Sridhar Ranganathan (serial entrepreneur and good friend who moved to Bangalore ~ 7 years ago) does not miss his Sunday morning round of golf at the KGA links for anything! His golf handicap is steadily getting better I‚Äôm told but I strongly suspect he‚Äôs sneaking in an odd round during the week as well (there! that‚Äôs how rumors are started).

Ajay (my colleague who moved from San Diego to Bangalore 3 years ago) gets his weekly dose of adrenalin by playing several games of squash at his apartment club house.

When we moved to Bangalore ~ 2yrs ago, I had grim forebodings that my dormant asthma might flare up (see [Asthma, Bangalore and me](http://ulaar.wordpress.com/2008/08/29/asthma-bangalore-and-me/)) so I had to choose a physical activity wisely. My choices narrowed down to squash (which I absolutely LOVED) or running (which I kinda sorta liked in a bursty irregular way). Running eventually won out because there were no squash courts within reasonable driving distance. Boy! Did I get lucky or what? I was introduced to a rabid Koramangala/HSR running gang and before I knew it, had run ~ 1200 km in 2009 ‚Äì completing my second and third marathons (see [Running the Course ‚Äì Mumbai Marathon 2010](http://ulaar.wordpress.com/2010/02/14/running-the-course-mumbai-marathon-2010/)) were merely a side effect.

The Three Bubbles will keep you nice and cozy during your initial year (a ‚Äònecessary‚Äô condition in [The Art of Returning to India](http://ulaar.wordpress.com/2010/02/20/the-art-of-returning-to-india/)) but I now believe that it‚Äôs the fourth bubble that‚Äôs the high-order bit (‚Äòsufficient‚Äô condition) in *staying-put* for the long haul.
