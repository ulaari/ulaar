1 year 10 months and 3 non-SLR camera phones later, below is a partial collection of India-defining frames I’ve found interesting.

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/img_0155.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> Yes – there ARE parking signs in Bangalore. Just try finding them. </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/13012009266.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> TVS Moped with less than regulation (i.e. 20%) load </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/04012009220.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> This is a glass-half-full kinda kid – “look at all the traffic we are AHEAD of!” </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/11012009259.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> Where else in the world do we have Midnight Marathons? Venue: Whitefield Road </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/img_0082.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> This may seem like graffiti but it’s NOT – I insist that this plot is NOT FOR SALE! </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/img_0055.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> One sign, two messages! For some strange reason, reminded of that famous pre-Independence sign “Dogs and Indians not allowed!” </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/img_0081.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> Sign inside Bethany High School boys </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/14022009593.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> If at first you don’t spell it right, you must try and TRY again! </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/22012009286.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> In case you haven’t noticed, India’s spelling bee champs have all moved to USA. </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/img_4449-2.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> How many spelling mistakes can you spot? </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/img_0240.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> Indians love to pun.. really! </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/img_0292.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> A yr after being commissioned into service, this stainless steel vessel one day just gave up! 7 vertical cracks appeared simultaneously after a rasam production! </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/img_0001.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> Wish we had this sign in OUR apartment complex..Then we could fret about dog owners ignoring it. </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/img_0168.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> It’s not just the BMW and Mercedes you’ll see on Bangalore roads. Toyota MR2 for the discerning. </p>

![](../../../../uploads/2010/06/24012009291.jpg) <p style="text-align: center;"> Time to visit the optometrist? Don’t bother. Any of these store signs can be used for vision check. </p>
