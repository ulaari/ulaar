One of the challenges I face at the beginning of many new posts is the realization that a prequel needs to be written first. I would argue with and convince myself “but there’s this background I need to provide..” The background becomes the first paragraph and before I know it, it becomes chunky enough to warrant its own post but … the prequel post still isn’t ‘done’ so, you see, I can’t hit the PUBLISH button. Meanwhile, the original post still sits unfinished in the Drafts folder (actually my ‘handwritten notes’ courtesy my relatively new Lamy fountain pen). Talking of the [Lamy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamy), I must mention that I acquired it in early April from [William Penn](http://williampenn.net/) after a year of hobnobbing with my pen connoisseur/friend (Aunindo Ghosh) who, by the way, has just written this amazing post about [a walk in the forests of Wayanad, Kerala](http://ofourwalks.wordpress.com/2010/06/05/leafy-leechy-liberating/). Returning to the Lamy, I ought to mention that the inaugural handwritten post I wrote is entitled *The keyboard of the nineteenth century* — it’s two pages long and nearly complete (which means that it needs a final ink writing session before the WordPress.com upload/edit).

When I started this post (on WordPress), the title was *Of ABCDs and FOBs*, a post which I had nearly completed (on Lamy ink and paper). After typing the first two sentences (which weren’t present in the original ink draft), I realized that I wasn’t going to complete it tonight so one thing led to another… The *Of ABCDs and FOBs* post itself was going to serve as a prequel to another post that’s been in the hopper for… (Err..Let’s see) a mere 6 months – *Indian Born Confused Desi (IBCD)*.

So I end yet another weekend where I promised myself that I’d publish one of the 3-5 half-finished posts and…broke my promise. Yet I managed to write this lament and, surprisingly, had fun with it. Moreover, next weekend is another weekend (thank you, Scarlett O’ Hara – thou queen of all optimists!)
