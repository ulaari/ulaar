Additional commentary

- Park timings seem to mirror temple timings though I haven’t verified whether the park is actually closed between 10am and 4pm.
- *Only clockwise walking*. Compliance rate is similar to that for the *One-way* and *Maintain Lane Discipline* signs you see on Indian roads.
- *Fencing around the fountain for exercises* – interesting phrase I say. Btw, the word fountain is merely aspirational.
- *Cleanliness is next to godliness*. If all the non-park public spaces were 1/10th as clean as the Koramangala parks, now THAT would be aspirational!
- In Indian English, “Dirty” can take the form of a verb.
- *Playing in the Park* prohibited? Aw come on!
