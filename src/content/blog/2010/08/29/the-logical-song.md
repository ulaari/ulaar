I’ve been enjoying Supertramp’s Logical Song since the mid-90’s but it’s only recently, with the perspective of a parent thinking about education paradigms for kids, that the song’s message hits home. If your musical journey has somehow missed Supertramp’s Breakfast in America album, I strongly recommend it – never too late I say. I’ve reproduced the lyrics for my lazy friends (courtesy[LyricsFreak.com](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/supertramp/the+logical+song_20133850.html#)):

*When I was young, it seemed like life was so wonderful, it was beautiful, magical*

*And all the birds in the trees, well they’d be singing so happily, joyfully, playfully, watching me*

*And then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible, logical, responsible, practical*

*And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable, clinical, intellectual, cynical*

*There are times when all the world’s asleep*

*The questions run too deep for such a simple man*

*Won’t you please, please tell me what we’ve learned*

*I know it sounds absurd but please tell me who I am*

*I said now, watch what you say, now we’re calling you a radical, a liberal, fanatical, criminal*

*Won’t you sign up your name, we’d like to feel you’re acceptable, respectable, presentable, a vegetable*

*But at night, when all the world’s asleep*

*The questions run so deep for such a simple man*

*Won’t you please (Won’t you tell me), (You can tell me what) please tell me what we’ve learned (Can you hear me?)*

*I know it sounds absurd, (Won’t you help me) please tell me who I am, who am I, who am I, who am I*

*But I’m thinking so logical*

*Did you call, one two three four*

*It’s getting unbelievable*

The Wikipedia article on [The Logical Song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Logical_Song) had the following commentary: The lyrics are a “story of innocence and idealism lost with Hodgson (band member and song writer) condemning an education system not focused on knowledge and sensitivity. The song tells the story of a man who:

- is taken away from the unspoilt immediacy of childhood (*When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful, a miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical*),
- undergoes education (*but then they sent me away to teach me how to be sensible, logical, responsible, practical*),
- sees a future prepared for him lacking any spontaneity of reaction (*And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable, clinical, intellectual, cynical*),
- feels constricted in his freedom of speech (*Now watch what you say or they’ll be calling you a radical, a liberal, fanatical, criminal*),
- is put under pressure to conform (*Won’t you sign up your name, we’d like to feel you’re acceptable, respectable, presentable, a vegetable*)
- and ends up confused, without a coherent self-image (*please tell me who I am*).
