Two years ago, at the early stage of my India job hunt, I was talking to an executive at a large technology firm. I had just finished telling him about my two prior attempts to move to Bangalore (in 2004 and 2006) and that I was hoping for third-time-lucky in 2008. Clearly the number of Indians contemplating the return back to the homeland was increasing year-over-year but I was still surprised by his analogy ‚Äúif 2004 was a trickle, 2008 is like a flood‚Äù!

Fast forward to 2010 and we have the front page of Yahoo India with the following story ‚Äì [India Calling US ‚Äì Job Fair 2010](http://in.news.yahoo.com/32/20100803/1053/tnl-india-calling-us-job-fair2010_1.html). [Shine.com](http://indiacalling.shine.com/) (a venture of Hindustan Times) is organizing this US road show. Excerpts from the story:

- Apparently 60,000 Indian professionals working and settled abroad returned to India last year. (I‚Äôve been hunting for this stat for a while btw).
- Job fair #1 at Raritan Center, New Jersey on Aug 28 and 29
- Job fair #2 at Santa Clara Convention Center ‚Äì Sep 3 and 4.
- *This job fair will also provide an opportunity for NRIs to meet up with real estate consultants representatives from major educational institutes in India to facilitate relocation and ironing out procedures for their children‚Äôs education needs back home. India Calling looks like an event well packaged to provide a complete career shift and relocation platform for NRIs.*

A big shout-out to all my *passive should-we* friends in US (especially those in Northern California and New York/New Jersey area), if you are too lazy to visit India for your job search, India will come to you! üôÇ If you are wondering what-the-heck I meant by *passive should-we*, you can quickly peruse [The two types of Indian immigrants](http://ulaar.wordpress.com/2008/06/04/the-two-types-of-indian-immigrants/).
