For a dip stick on what this blog is about, you can start with [A slice of uLaaR](https://www.ulaar.com/2020/09/24/a-slice-of-ulaar/) - a post that strings together 11 posts that I'm *not ashamed* of, across 4 major categories. 

The evolution of the uLaaR blog went something like this:

- Started on Feb 6, 2008 with [Etymology of ulaar](https://www.ulaar.com/2008/02/22/etymology-of-ulaar/) and [A time to Qik](https://www.ulaar.com/2008/02/07/a-time-to-qik/)
- Between May 2008 and 2010, the blog was largely focused on the “Return to India” theme with posts such as [this](https://www.ulaar.com/2008/05/20/16-years-later/), [this](https://www.ulaar.com/2008/08/29/asthma-bangalore-and-me/) and this; “setting down in India” posts like [100 days in Bangalore](https://www.ulaar.com/2008/12/14/100-days-in-bangalore-part1/) and [The Janus Man](https://www.ulaar.com/2009/07/17/the-janus-man/).
- Guest posts in 2010-11 in the [R2I Voices](https://www.ulaar.com/category/r2i-2/r2ia-voices/) category
- The running theme made a splashy entrance with a detailed account of [Mumbai Marathon 2010](https://www.ulaar.com/2010/01/28/my-road-to-mumbai-marathon-2010/). I think it’s safe to admit that Long Distance Running has remained the dominant theme of this blog.
- Barefoot running, as a sub-genre, burst on to this blog in Jun 2012 with [It’s all a vast upper body conspiracy](https://www.ulaar.com/2012/06/14/its-all-a-vast-upper-body-conspiracy/) and there’s been no looking back on [Barefootia](https://www.ulaar.com/category/barefootia-2/).
- [Minimalism](https://www.ulaar.com/categories/minimalism), [vegan life](https://www.ulaar.com/category/vegan-life/), and [food ](https://www.ulaar.com/category/food-2/)have been more recent focus areas.
