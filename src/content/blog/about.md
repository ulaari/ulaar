**About Blog**

This blog was started to chronicle the year-long sabbatical of the blogger as he sought to understand the fascinating world of social enterprises. The May 2011 post ([Boiling the social enterprise ocean](https://www.techsangam.com/2011/05/17/boiling-the-social-enterprise-ocean/)) provides a slice into the kind of social enterprises TechSangam would be covering. Categories of focus include agriculture, rural markets, financial inclusion, education, health, rural tourism, water, sanitation, and off-grid energy. Inspiration for this blog came from Arthur C. Clarkeâ€™s [Childhood's End](http://www.techsangam.com/2011/03/11/evolution-of-the-human-race-3/). 

The blog inexorably lost some steam as the sabbatical reached a [logical end](https://www.techsangam.com/2013/08/18/a-different-kind-of-indian-city/). A pivotal epiphany in this blog's journey was shared in Sep 2016 - [Dropping the social in social entrepreneur](https://www.techsangam.com/2016/09/07/dropping-the-social-in-social-entrepreneur/).
