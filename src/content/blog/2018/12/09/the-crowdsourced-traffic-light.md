I’ve been wanting to write this post since 2009. Really. Have a look at [Year in Bangalore – the Unwritten Posts](http://www.ulaar.com/2009/09/06/a-year-in-bangalore-the-unwritten-blog-posts/).

When we moved to Bangalore 10 years ago, good reason prevailed to not get immediately behind the wheel of a car. My last driving stint in Indian conditions was over a decade ago – in the sleepy town of Visakhapatnam. After getting accustomed to the traffic density, the [driving patterns](http://www.ulaar.com/2010/03/05/dont-be-alarmed-normal-driving-patterns-in-india/), the barely perceptible gaps between vehicles, and eventually getting sufficient practice negotiating the right turn (on an unmanned traffic signal), I eventually got a license and started driving.

Gary Smith, a dear friend from my Chicago days (who incidentally introduced me to the [wonderful sport of disc golf](http://www.ulaar.com/2011/08/22/that-one-perfect-drive/)), had this to say about his mid-1990’s trip to Beijing: *scores of speeding two-wheelers and cars hurtling towards an intersection from 4 directions and miraculously nobody gets hurt!* My rejoinder to Gary – *you ain’t seen anything yet, buddy! Come visit an Indian city!*

Urban planners have a minimalist approach towards traffic signals. Start with the assumption that no intersection *requires* a traditional (red/yellow/green) signal. It’s only required once a crowdsourced signal starts to break down.

For the first world reader who has never visited India, I need to describe the Great Indian Game that’s the crowdsourced signal.

Two perpendicular flows of motorists at an intersection represent two opposing teams playing a game. A rather simple game actually but it plays out with many variations due to the diversity of motorists – from the super aggressive to the timid. There are two primary rules of engagement:

- If your team owns the flow, your role (as a motorist) is just to maintain flow continuity. This means, among other things, staying as close to the vehicle ahead to minimize the other team’s chances of *stealing* the flow.
- If your team does not own the flow, your role (as a motorist) is to take a lead or supporting role in stealing the flow.

Metaphorically, a special kind of garden hose (with a perpendicular connector) can be used to explain the ebbing and flowing of the traffic patterns. The team that *does not* own the flow, has to start pinching the opposing direction’s hose, thereby narrowing the breadth of the flow. The pinching happens either by the group of frontline motorists, a collective moving-forward into the well of the intersection or.. by aggressive motorist(s) who can move quickly and block a section of the opposing flow. As the flow starts stuttering and thinning, motorists from the other team capitalize, cross-over and establish the next prevailing flow.. until it’s time for the flow to change again.

May the flow be with you. At your next crowdsourced traffic light.
