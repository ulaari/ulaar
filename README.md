## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Run development server.**

    Navigate into the siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd techsangam/
    gatsby develop
    ```

    The site will run at `http://localhost:8000`!

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    All the blog's content is inside `src/content` directory. To create a new blog post, create a new file and start writing content. Make sure to add the post metadata on top of the file inside `---` lines. Check out other blog posts to find out what metadata to add.

3. **Push new blog to the site**    

    Once you're done editing the post, push it to the github repository:

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "New blog post"
    git push origin master
    ```

4. **Publish blog to the live website through netlify**

    Netlify should automatically build the site but won't publish it if `Auto deploy` is not turned on. Go to https://app.netlify.com - Open `Deploys` tab - Click `Start auto publishing` to turn on Auto deploy.

    From next time onwards, netlify will automatically publish the new changes to the live website after `git push`.
